OAB-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on legal writing tasks from the Brazilian Bar Examination (OAB) Phase 2. The benchmark comprises 210 questions across seven areas of law from six editions (39–44) of the exam.

- Evaluates LLMs on their ability to write legal documents and answer discursive questions
- Includes comprehensive evaluation guidelines used by human examiners
- Supports two judge output formats:
**structured**(recommended) and non-structured - The evaluation pipeline uses LLMs as automated judges, achieving strong correlation with human scores

The codebase is based on FastChat and can be installed via pip:

```
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/maritaca-ai/oab-bench.git
# Or install from local source
git clone https://github.com/maritaca-ai/oab-bench.git
cd oab-bench
pip install -e .
```

The benchmark evaluation pipeline consists of three steps:

Sabiá-4:

```
python3 -m gen_api_answer \
--model sabia-4-2026-01-08 \
--api-base "https://chat.maritaca.ai/api" \
--api-key "your-api-key-here" \
--parallel 10
```

GPT-5.2:

```
python3 -m gen_api_answer \
--model gpt-5.2 \
--api-key "your-openai-key" \
--parallel 10
```

Gemini-3-pro-preview:

```
python3 -m gen_api_answer \
--model gemini-3-pro-preview \
--api-base "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/" \
--api-key "your-google-key" \
--parallel 10 # Google models ignore --max-tokens
```

We recommend using GPT-5.2 as the judge model with **structured output** (`--structured`

). Judgments are generated with `reasoning_effort="high"`

.

**Structured output (recommended):**

```
python3 -m gen_judgment \
--judge-model gpt-5.2 \
--model-list sabia-4-2026-01-06 \
--api-base "https://api.openai.com/v1" \
--api-key "your-openai-key" \
--parallel 10 \
--structured
```

Non-structured (legacy):

```
python3 -m gen_judgment \
--judge-model gpt-5.2 \
--model-list sabia-4-2026-01-06 \
--api-base "https://api.openai.com/v1" \
--api-key "your-openai-key" \
--parallel 10
```

Evaluation of 12 LLMs on OAB-Bench using GPT-5.2 as judge with structured output:

| Model | Average Score | Passing Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini-3.1-Pro | 9.39 | 42/42 (100%) |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | 8.82 | 42/42 (100%) |
| GPT-5.2 | 8.66 | 42/42 (100%) |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 8.27 | 42/42 (100%) |
| Sabiá-4 | 7.96 | 42/42 (100%) |
| Gemini-3.1-Flash-Lite | 7.60 | 39/42 (93%) |
| Sabiazinho-4 | 6.91 | 34/42 (81%) |
| Sabiá-3.1 | 6.91 | 35/42 (83%) |
| Qwen3.5-397B | 6.69 | 31/42 (74%) |
| GPT-5-Mini | 6.52 | 31/42 (74%) |
| Qwen3.5-35B | 6.17 | 24/42 (57%) |
| Sabiazinho-3 | 6.12 | 26/42 (62%) |

Passing rate indicates the number of exams (out of 42) where the model scored ≥ 6.0. Each exam corresponds to one of the seven areas of law in a given edition.

We recommend the **structured** evaluation format for two reasons:

**Auditable**: each scoring item produces a structured JSON object with`item_id`

,`item_description`

,`analysis`

, and`score`

, making it easy to inspect and audit individual judgments.**No arithmetic errors**: the total score is computed programmatically by summing item scores, rather than being extracted from free text via regex — eliminating the risk of the judge model making arithmetic mistakes.

Comparative results between the two formats (GPT-5.2 judge):

| Model | Structured | Non-Structured |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini-3.1-Pro | 9.39 | 9.34 |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | 8.82 | 8.80 |
| GPT-5.2 | 8.66 | 8.61 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 8.27 | 8.23 |
| Sabiá-4 | 7.96 | 7.92 |
| Gemini-3.1-Flash-Lite | 7.60 | 7.57 |
| Sabiazinho-4 | 6.91 | 6.92 |
| Sabiá-3.1 | 6.91 | 6.89 |
| Qwen3.5-397B | 6.69 | 6.67 |
| GPT-5-Mini | 6.52 | 6.50 |
| Qwen3.5-35B | 6.17 | 6.18 |
| Sabiazinho-3 | 6.12 | 6.07 |

Scores are nearly identical across formats, with the same model ranking. The structured format is slightly more expensive (~8%) but provides full traceability of the judge's reasoning.

Cost breakdown for evaluating all 12 models on 210 questions using GPT-5.2 as judge:

| Metric | Structured | Non-Structured |
|---|---|---|
| Total cost | $63.85 | $58.28 |
| Cost per model | $5.32 | $4.86 |
| Prompt tokens | 7,805,993 | 6,936,593 |
| Completion tokens | 3,709,936 | 3,381,311 |

Pricing based on GPT-5.2 rates: $1.75/1M input tokens, $0.175/1M cached input tokens, $14.00/1M output tokens.

When using `--structured`

, the judge produces a `JudgmentResult`

object (Pydantic) with the following schema:

```
class ItemEvaluation(BaseModel):
item_id: str # Item identifier (e.g., '1', '2', 'A', 'B')
item_description: str # Item description from the scoring table
analysis: str # Detailed analysis comparing the candidate's answer with the reference
score: float # Score assigned to the item
class JudgmentResult(BaseModel):
items: List[ItemEvaluation] # List of evaluated items
total_score: float # Total score (sum of all item scores)
```

Each question's scoring table items are evaluated independently, and the `total_score`

is the sum of all `score`

fields — ensuring arithmetic correctness.
