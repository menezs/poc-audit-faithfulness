Better Open Source LLMs for Portuguese


###### Abstract

We present Tucano 2, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs) with 0.5-3.7 billion parameters, designed to address certain gaps in open-source development for Portuguese LLMs. Following our previous works, we now extend our dataset, GigaVerbo-v2, to a new degree of quality and scale, while also introducing a new synthetic dataset, GigaVerbo-v2 Synth, aimed at filling missing gaps in GigaVerbo-v2, and two post-training datasets, GigaVerbo-v2 SFT and GigaVerbo-v2 Preferences, that allow Portuguese LLMs to be trained in domains like retrieval augmented generation, coding, tool use, chain-of-thought reasoning, and many other domains of interest. Through extensive ablation studies, we design both pretraining and continual pretraining recipes for the Tucano 2 suite (Base, Instruct, and Think), which achieve state-of-the-art performance on several Portuguese-language modeling benchmarks. We also extend and refine the evaluation harness introduced in our earlier work, yielding a comprehensive evaluation suite that provides strong signals across different pretraining, continual pretraining, and post-training regimes. All artifacts associated with Tucano 2 are openly released, including training recipes, logs, and source code, ensuring that our work is reproducible, accessible, and extendable by the broader Portuguese NLP community.

## 1 Overview

Large language models (LLMs) have radically transformed NLP, but the fruits of this progress have been unevenly distributed across languages (cohere2024gap). High-resource languages such as English have vast amounts of data and state-of-the-art models, whereas many low-resource languages lag far behind (hedderich-etal-2021-survey; ranathunga2021neuralmachinetranslationlowresource; joshi-etal-2020-state). Multilingual models still exhibit large performance gaps across underrepresented languages (virtanen2019multilingualenoughbertfinnish; Martin_2020; armengolestape2021multilingualmodelsbestchoice; Corr_a_2025), and reliance on closed, compute-intensive foundations limits adoption in resource-poor settings. It is worth further stressing the (un)reproducibility aspect. In Portuguese, for example, although recent years have seen growing interest in language-specific modeling (silva2025evaluationaiethicstools; Cruz-Castaneda_Amadeus_2025), only a small number of models have been developed and released in a fully open manner. Most high-performing systems remain closed-source or provide limited transparency regarding data, training procedures, and evaluation (abonizio2025sabia3technicalreport; gaia-gemma-3-4b-2025; jurema_7b_2025). This lack of openly available models, datasets, and reproducible recipes constrains independent research, hinders community-driven improvements, and potentially slows the creation of downstream applications. Consequently, there remains substantial space for the open-source community to contribute foundational LLM resources that are openly accessible, reproducible, and tailored to low-resource scenarios.

Meanwhile, the frontier of open-weight models is rapidly advancing. A new generation of publicly released LLMs is increasingly rivaling (or even surpassing) leading proprietary systems across a range of benchmarks. For example, recent models from DeepSeek AI (deepseekai2025deepseekv3technicalreport) have been reported to match or exceed OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google’s Gemini 3.0 Pro across several reasoning and coding evaluations. Similarly, Moonshot AI’s trillion-parameter Kimi K2 (kimiteam2026kimik2openagentic) has demonstrated competitive or superior performance relative to Claude Sonnet 4.5 on demanding reasoning benchmarks. These trends, alongside strong results from the GLM series (5team2025glm45agenticreasoningcoding), demonstrate that open-weight models can approach the capabilities of state-of-the-art proprietary systems.

However, coming back to the (un)reproducibility aspect, it is important to distinguish between open-weight and open-source models. While many recent releases provide access to trained parameters, only a small number of projects disclose the complete stack required for reproducible LLM development, including training data, preprocessing pipelines, hyperparameters, and evaluation protocols. Notable exceptions include the SmolLM (allal2025smollm2smolgoesbig; bakouch2025smollm3) and OLMo series (groeneveld2024olmoacceleratingsciencelanguage; olmo2025olmo3), among other inspiring efforts (liu2023llm360; zhou2025megamath; k2team2025k2v2360openreasoningenhancedllm; apertus2025apertusdemocratizingopencompliant). These initiatives exemplify a growing movement toward transparent, reproducible LLM research, in which models are accompanied by the artifacts needed for inspection, verification, and retraining. Nevertheless, such fully open efforts remain rare, particularly for low-resource languages, underscoring a critical gap—and an opportunity—for projects that prioritize openness and reproducibility.

In prior work, we sought to “seed the soil” for Portuguese NLP by providing foundational resources and models in an open-source fashion. In correa2024teenytinyllama, we explored whether monolingual models could outperform multilingual ones when trained to the level recommended by the Chinchilla scaling laws (hoffmann2022training) as compute-optimal. One of our main findings was that the 460-million-parameter version of our native models (the TeenyTinyLlama pair) outperformed some multilingual models (e.g., Bloom 1b7 (workshop2022bloom)) while approaching others (e.g., Qwen (bai2023qwen)).

In correa2025tucanoadvancingneuraltext, we started the Tucano series. While the TTL pair was trained up to the theoretical optimal-compute allocation set by hoffmann2022training—20 tokens parameter—this series, we opted to follow certain results from the literature that showed that models past a certain size ( 400 million parameters) tend to endure saturation for longer (biderman2023pythia; touvron2023llama), hence, leading us to experiment with more prolonged training runs. Something enabled by our data curation pipeline, resulting in the (at the time of release) largest Portuguese text dataset ever assembled: GigaVerbo, a 200B-token Portuguese corpus we used to train the first Tucanos.

The first iteration of the Tucano series demonstrated highly promising results, with natively pretrained models outperforming—or matching—the performance of multilingual models of comparable size that were trained with substantially larger computational budgets and far broader multilingual corpora. However, the open-weight multilingual landscape has evolved dramatically, and achieving performance on par with current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs—such as Qwen3 (yang2025qwen3)—has become increasingly challenging, prompting us to rethink and redesign our approaches to developing language models tailored to specific linguistic domains.

In this work, we introduce Tucano 2, a new generation of open Portuguese LLMs that substantially extends our earlier efforts. We construct a large-scale, high-quality Portuguese corpus of approximately 320 billion tokens, enriched with educational and toxicity annotations and complemented by 9.3 billion synthetic tokens to mitigate domain gaps. To support data curation, we develop auxiliary datasets and train specialized annotation models for educational content, toxicity, and instruction quality. We further assemble a diverse supervised fine-tuning (SFT) corpus covering coding, tool use, structured outputs, mathematical problem solving, and chain-of-thought reasoning, and release a novel dual-reasoning preference dataset to further power direct alignment efforts. Leveraging these resources, we train a family of Portuguese LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 0.5B to 3.5B, using pretraining and continual pretraining regimes. Our models achieve strong gains over prior open Portuguese baselines and outperform similarly sized multilingual models across multiple Portuguese benchmarks. Finally, we release a comprehensive evaluation harness for Portuguese that supports assessment at both early and late training stages, including long-context settings.

In summary, our main contributions are:

-
•
Large-scale Portuguese corpus. A 320B-token cleaned corpus with rich educational and toxicity annotations (GigaVerbo-v2), plus 9.3B synthetic tokens for domain coverage (GigaVerbo-v2 Synth).

-
•
Annotation and filtering models. Educational, toxicity, and instruction-quality classifiers trained from new auxiliary datasets and released for community use.

-
•
Diverse SFT data. A large supervised fine-tuning collection spanning coding, tool calling, structured output, reasoning, and mathematics (GigaVerbo-v2 SFT).

## 2 Related Work

In our previous work with Tucano, we presented a detailed timeline of large language model development in Portuguese (correa2025tucanoadvancingneuraltext), highlighting key milestones and models that have advanced NLP in the language up to 2024.111A timeline of releases and publications is available in github.com/Nkluge-correa/Tucano/blob/main/img/timeline.pdf. In 2025, substantial progress was made in both Portuguese-specific and multilingual language model development. This section surveys key releases that inform the context and baselines for our work, focusing on models that either target Portuguese or include comprehensive Portuguese support within a multilingual framework. For further exposés on this topic, specifically where it comes to the developments tied to the field in Portuguese, we refer readers to the works of silva2025evaluationaiethicstools and Cruz-Castaneda_Amadeus_2025.

### 2.1 Portuguese-Centric Models

##### Curió.

The Curió family (almeida2025buildinghighqualitydatasetsportuguese) represents a continued pretraining approach that adapts English LLaMA models (TinyLLaMA-1T and LLaMA-2-7B) to Portuguese. Curió-1B and Curió-7B are trained on approximately 150 billion tokens drawn primarily from the ClassiCC-PT corpus, leveraging cross-lingual transfer to inherit structural knowledge from their English base models. Meanwhile, Curió-Edu (almeida2025curioedu7bexaminingdata) focuses training on educational and STEM-filtered subsets of the corpus (roughly 20 billion tokens). Despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the compute, Curió-Edu-7B reportedly outperforms the full-corpus Curió-7B on Portuguese benchmarks, highlighting the value of domain-focused curation. Both model families are openly released on Hugging Face under the ClassiCC-PT project.

##### GAIA.

GAIA (gaia-gemma-3-4b-2025) is a 4-billion-parameter Brazilian Portuguese model derived from Google’s Gemma-3-4b-pt through continual pretraining on approximately 13 billion tokens of high-quality Portuguese data (scientific articles, Wikipedia, and curated web sources). The model card mentions the use of weight-merging techniques across training stages, though detailed dataset composition and training logs are not publicly disclosed. GAIA targets Brazilian Portuguese applications and has been evaluated on language-specific benchmarks such as the ENEM (silveira2017university) and OAB exam (d2017passing).

##### Jurema-7B.

Targeting the Brazilian legal domain, Jurema-7B (jurema_7b_2025) fine-tunes Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on a synthetic question-answer dataset generated from high-quality legal documents. The model’s specialization yields substantial gains on domain-specific tasks. Jurema-7B is released under the Apache 2.0 license for research use, but no accompanying academic publication provides training details.

##### Amadeus-Verbo.

Cruz-Castañeda and Amadeus (cruzcastaneda2025amadeusverbotechnicalreportpowerful) introduce Amadeus-Verbo, a family of Brazilian Portuguese models spanning 0.5B to 72B parameters. Built on the Qwen2.5 series, these models include base-tuned, merged, and instruction-tuned variants. Although the models are publicly released on Hugging Face, the composition of the Brazilian Portuguese training corpus is not disclosed.

##### Carvalho.

Carvalho (gamallo2024galician) is a bilingual Galician–European Portuguese decoder model (1.3B parameters) developed via continual pretraining from Cerebras-GPT-1.3B dey2023cerebrasgptopencomputeoptimallanguage. Trained on over 6 billion words of mixed Galician and Portuguese text with a jointly learned tokenizer, Carvalho demonstrates strong performance on Galician generation tasks and provides a valuable resource for closely related Ibero-Romance languages.

### 2.2 Multilingual Models with Portuguese Coverage

The multilingual frontier in 2025 is characterized by significant scale increases and architectural innovations that bring open-weight models (supporting Portuguese) closer to state-of-the-art performance across languages.

##### Qwen3.

Alibaba’s Qwen3 family (yang2025qwen3) represents a landmark release, with models spanning from 0.6B to 235B parameters (including mixture-of-experts variants). Pretrained on approximately 36 trillion tokens covering 119 languages, Qwen3 achieves competitive results with leading proprietary models on coding, mathematics, and general reasoning benchmarks. The dense models support up to 128K tokens and are released under the Apache 2.0 license. Notably, Qwen3-4B rivals the much larger Qwen2.5-72B on several tasks, illustrating substantial efficiency gains. The series also introduces dual-mode inference—a think mode for step-by-step reasoning and non-think for rapid responses—enabling flexible deployment under latency and quality constraints.

##### Gemma 3.

Google DeepMind’s Gemma 3 series (gemmateam2025gemma3technicalreport) comprises five core variants (270M, 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B parameters), with multimodal capabilities (text and image) in the larger models and support for over 140 languages. Gemma3-4B matches Gemma 2’s 27B model on key benchmarks, and Gemma3-27B rivals Gemini 1.5 Pro. All models support 128K token contexts and are released under the “Gemma Terms of Use”.

##### Falcon 3.

The Technology Innovation Institute’s Falcon 3 family (Falcon3) includes models at 1B, 3B, 7B, and 10B scales, trained on approximately 14 trillion tokens of English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French data. Falcon3-10B achieves state-of-the-art results among sub-13B models, with particularly strong performance on mathematical reasoning. The models support up to 32K token contexts and are released under TII’s permissive Falcon License.

##### Other Notable Releases.

Beyond domain or language-specific models, two fully open releases merit attention for their transparency and multilingual scope. SmolLM3 (bakouch2025smollm3), a 3-billion-parameter model from Hugging Face, supports six languages (including Portuguese) and offers dual-mode instruct/reasoning control with explicit think and no_think flags. It supports 128K token contexts and is released with complete training blueprints. OLMo 3 (olmo2025olmo3), developed by the Allen Institute for AI, provides 7B- and 32B-parameter models with full transparency—data, checkpoints, and training recipes are all openly released. OLMo 3-Think variants emphasize intermediate reasoning and are designed to facilitate custom-domain adaptation and post-training experimentation.

## 3 Pretraining Data

A high-quality pretraining corpus is foundational to effective language model development. In our prior work with Tucano, we introduced GigaVerbo, a large-scale Portuguese text corpus comprising over 200 billion tokens across 145 million documents (correa2025tucanoadvancingneuraltext). GigaVerbo was created by aggregating a wide range of openly available Portuguese datasets hosted on Hugging Face, including web crawls, encyclopedic articles, blogs, translated conversational datasets, legal documents, and instruction-following corpora. To ensure consistency and quality, the corpus underwent exact hash deduplication and was filtered using a fine-tuned BERTimbau classifier trained on 110K GPT-4o-annotated samples, thereby removing low-quality text. At the time of its release, GigaVerbo was among the largest openly available Portuguese text corpora, alongside other notable efforts such as ClassiCC-PT (almeida2025buildinghighqualitydatasetsportuguese), Jabuticaba (Cruz-Castaneda_Amadeus_2025), and CrawlPT (garcia2024crawlptlargescalecleanedportugueseweb).

In this work, we introduce GigaVerbo-v2, an updated and substantially improved version of the original corpus. The development of GigaVerbo-v2 was informed by recent advances in corpus construction methodology, particularly the emphasis on language-specific filtering, learned quality classifiers, and synthetic data augmentation. We first survey related efforts in Portuguese corpus construction to contextualize our approach, then detail the technical pipeline used to build GigaVerbo-v2.

### 3.1 Related Data Efforts

##### CrawlPT.

Developed by garcia2024crawlptlargescalecleanedportugueseweb, CrawlPT is a large-scale Portuguese corpus constructed by aggregating three major open-source datasets: brWaC, the Portuguese subset of CC100, and the Portuguese portion of OSCAR-2301. The resulting collection comprises over 52 million deduplicated documents, providing a broad, general-purpose snapshot of Portuguese web text, primarily derived from the Common Crawl. The preprocessing pipeline includes tokenization, language filtering, and extensive document-level deduplication. CrawlPT was used to train RoBERTaLexPT-base and RoBERTaCrawlPT-base. Additionally, the authors released LegalPT, a legal-domain dataset comprising more than 24 million documents aggregated from publicly available Portuguese-language legal data. All resources are openly available on Hugging Face.

##### ClassiCC-PT.

Developed by almeida2025buildinghighqualitydatasetsportuguese, ClassiCC-PT is built directly from raw Common Crawl snapshots using a principled and fully auditable pipeline inspired by the FineWeb series (penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb; penedo2025fineweb2pipelinescale). The resulting corpus contains approximately 120 billion tokens and achieves performance comparable to industrial-grade corpora such as ClueWeb22, despite being constructed entirely from open infrastructure using publicly reproducible methods. ClassiCC-PT and its accompanying resources, including learned filters for Portuguese and the Curió model family, are openly released on Hugging Face.

##### Jabuticaba.

Developed by Cruz-Castaneda_Amadeus_2025, Jabuticaba is the largest commercial corpus of Portuguese text, comprising 669 GB (approximately 139 billion tokens) of curated data primarily sourced from Brazilian web content. The corpus employs a comprehensive methodological pipeline that includes language detection, content filtering, quality assessment, toxicity removal, normalization, and deduplication. Unlike GigaVerbo and ClassiCC-PT, the implementation details of Jabuticaba’s pipeline are not fully open-sourced, though the authors provide a thorough description of their approach. The dataset itself is not publicly available due to its commercial nature, and to our knowledge, no published ablation studies or trained models using Jabuticaba as the primary pretraining corpus have been released.

### 3.2 GigaVerbo-v2: Construction

The recent landscape of corpus construction reveals several converging methodological insights that informed our development of GigaVerbo-v2:

-
•
Language-specific filtering: Works such as ClassiCC-PT and FineWeb 2 demonstrate that language-specific filtering pipelines outperform multilingual, English-centric approaches (almeida2025buildinghighqualitydatasetsportuguese; penedo2025fineweb2pipelinescale).

-
•
Quality over quantity: Both ClassiCC-PT and FineWeb-Edu show that data selection and quality filtering are more important than raw scale for effective model pretraining, as measured by downstream performance on ablation studies (penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb).

-
•
Learned filters: The use of learned filters, particularly LLM-as-a-Judge approaches (gunasekar2023textbooksneed; penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb), has become increasingly popular for refining dataset quality beyond heuristic methods.

-
•
Synthetic data augmentation: There is a growing trend toward augmenting datasets with synthesized data. Works such as BeyondWeb (maini2025beyondweb) and Cosmopedia (allal2024cosmopedia) show that incorporating model-generated content can significantly enhance dataset quality.


With these insights in mind, our goals for GigaVerbo-v2 were to (1) increase the overall size of the corpus, (2) improve data quality through both heuristic and learned filtering, (3) augment the corpus with high-quality synthesized data, and (4) maintain full openness and reproducibility of the entire pipeline.

#### 3.2.1 Data Extraction and Language Identification

To ensure the creation of a high-quality Portuguese corpus, we implemented a data processing pipeline inspired by the FineWeb 2 methodology (penedo2025fineweb2pipelinescale) and used the Datatrove library (penedo2024datatrove). This pipeline combines text extraction, language identification, quality filtering, and deduplication to produce a clean text corpus.

For web-crawled data sourced from Common Crawl WARC files, we begin by extracting text content using the Trafilatura library (barbaresi-2021-trafilatura). This extraction step is bypassed for datasets sourced from Hugging Face, which often include pre-cleaned text, allowing direct input into subsequent filtering stages. As in the first version of GigaVerbo, we sought to consolidate a wide range of openly available Portuguese datasets hosted on Hugging Face, since these datasets have often already undergone some degree of cleaning and curation.222Since most datasets obtained from the Hub have already been processed from earlier Common Crawl dumps, reprocessing the same data would result in substantial redundant and wasteful resource allocation. Therefore, we limited our processing to Common Crawl dumps released after the publication dates of the external datasets we used, with a primary focus on the 2025 crawl releases. In total, after running all our quality filters, we retained 6 billion tokens of timely web content.

To ensure relevance and baseline quality, we apply an initial URL filter to remove documents from undesirable sources, using blocklists333github.com/maravento/blackweb. to exclude low-quality or inappropriate websites. This is followed by a language identification step using FastText (FT176) (joulin2016fasttextzipcompressingtextclassification). Documents are retained only if they are confidently classified as Portuguese, with a default confidence threshold of 0.65. To improve language identification accuracy, we perform a second round using GlotLID (Kargaran_2023) as the backend, setting the language score threshold to 0.87.444These configurations were imported from the settings used by penedo2025fineweb2pipelinescale.

#### 3.2.2 Data Filtering and Formatting

While the definition of document “quality” is inherently subjective and context-dependent, we operationalize quality based on several heuristic criteria that reflect linguistic coherence and structural integrity. Specifically, we import the filters developed by penedo2025fineweb2pipelinescale (FineWeb 2) and rae2022scalinglanguagemodelsmethods (MassiveText), tuning them to be more sensitive to Portuguese’s linguistic characteristics, including script, custom stop words, standard word lengths, and punctuation norms.

-
•
Repetition filtering (GopherRepetitionFilter): This filter removes documents with excessive repetition, which is particularly relevant for web data prone to boilerplate or auto-generated content.

-
•
Quality filtering (FineWebQualityFilter and GopherQualityFilter): These filters enforce constraints on document structure and content quality to ensure documents have adequate punctuation and natural text flow. They also evaluate lexical properties, such as average word length and the presence of Portuguese stop words (e.g., como, que, para, por, com).


Post-filtering, we apply formatting steps to correct encoding issues, remove personally identifiable information, and eliminate or replace undesirable patterns (e.g., excessive symbols).

#### 3.2.3 Data Deduplication

According to lee2022deduplicatingtrainingdatamakes, “deduplication allows us to train models that emit memorized text ten times less frequently and require fewer train steps to achieve the same or better accuracy.” We therefore implement a deduplication pipeline using the MinHash algorithm to address redundancy. MinHash scales efficiently across multiple CPU nodes and enables tuning of similarity thresholds.555Following penedo2025fineweb2pipelinescale, we use 14 buckets, 8 hashes per bucket, and 5-grams, employing xxHash for hashing.

For Hugging Face data sources, we expected substantial overlap, given that most available datasets originate from similar sources (e.g., Common Crawl). Therefore, for these datasets, we performed deduplication globally. For Common Crawl data, we performed deduplication on a per-snapshot basis, following penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb, as most of the snapshots we processed were relatively recent and distinct.

#### 3.2.4 Quality Annotation via LLM Judges

Recent work has demonstrated that learned quality filters, particularly those based on LLM judgments, can provide more nuanced quality control than heuristic methods alone (gunasekar2023textbooksneed; penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb). Following this approach, we augment our heuristic filtering pipeline with two complementary dimensions of learned filtering: educational quality and toxicity.

We employ Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct (qwen2025qwen25technicalreport) as an LLM judge to annotate document quality. This model was selected for its strong multilingual performance, support for the Portuguese language, and a permissive Apache-2.0 license, which enables open redistribution of the resulting annotations. We developed two evaluation protocols: an educational quality assessment inspired by FineWeb-Edu (penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb), which ranks documents on a 5-point Likert scale according to their suitability for educational use (primary through secondary level), and a toxicity assessment that evaluates the presence of harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content on a similar 5-point scale. Both prompts elicit structured JSON responses to facilitate automated processing. The complete prompts are provided in Appendix A.

We applied these evaluation protocols to a stratified random sample of 700,000 documents drawn from the deduplicated corpus, sampling proportionally across all data sources to ensure representativeness.

To enable efficient corpus-scale filtering, we distilled these LLM annotations into lightweight classification models. We fine-tuned several Portuguese encoder-based models—including BERTimbau (souza2020bertimbau), BERTabaporu (costa-etal-2023-bertabaporu), RoBERTaLexPT (garcia2024crawlptlargescalecleanedportugueseweb), RoBERTaCrawlPT (garcia2024crawlptlargescalecleanedportugueseweb), and DeBERTinha (campiotti2023debertinhamultistepapproachadapt)—on the annotated datasets following the training procedure of penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb. Each candidate model was evaluated on a held-out test set of 20,000 examples, with model selection based on macro F1 score. Detailed training configurations and full results are provided in Appendix B.

The best-performing models achieved competitive results: BERTimbau-large-cased obtained a macro F1 score of 0.57 on the 5-class educational quality task (0.79 F1 when binarized), while BERTabaporu-large-uncased achieved a macro F1 score of 0.60 on the 5-class toxicity task (0.70 F1 when binarized). These results are comparable to those reported by penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb and almeida2025buildinghighqualitydatasetsportuguese for similar filtering tasks in English and Portuguese, respectively. We release the top two performing models for each task.

#### 3.2.5 Final Data Composition

After applying the complete filtering pipeline—including text extraction, language identification, heuristic quality filtering, deduplication, and learned filtering using our trained classifiers—we performed two final post-processing steps: (1) removal of documents shorter than 50 tokens, and (2) separation of documents with a toxicity score greater than 3. Given that toxicity is a challenging issue in Portuguese web data, we retained the filtered documents as a separate subset (excluded) within our corpus, which may be valuable for future research on toxicity detection and mitigation in Portuguese NLP. The main subset (default) contains the final curated corpus used for model pretraining.

The resulting corpus, GigaVerbo-v2, comprises 372 million documents in the default subset, totaling approximately 834 GB and 318 billion tokens. The excluded subset contains an additional 2.9 million documents (7.8 GB, 3 billion tokens). Combined, the corpus provides 841.8 GB of Portuguese text spanning 320 billion tokens. Of the tokens in the default subset, approximately 119 billion (37%) are classified as educational content (edu_int_score 3), while the remaining 199 billion tokens (63%) comprise the remaining portion.

The corpus aggregates data from three primary source categories: Common Crawl snapshots (primarily from 2020–2025), curated datasets from Hugging Face (including web crawls, encyclopedic content, conversational data, and domain-specific corpora), and other openly available Portuguese resources (academic theses and public domain literature). Each document is annotated with educational quality and toxicity scores, enabling flexible filtering for downstream applications. Detailed information about data sources, licenses, token distributions per subset, and quality score distributions is provided in Appendix C.

### 3.3 GigaVerbo-v2-Synth: Synthetic Augmentation

To complement our web-sourced corpus, we generated a synthetic dataset named GigaVerbo-v2 Synth, inspired by approaches such as Cosmopedia (allal2024cosmopedia). The goal was to generate high-quality, diverse text data to fill gaps in domains where web data are scarce or of low quality.

##### Generation Pipeline.

Our pipeline consisted of four stages: (1) carefully crafted prompts to steer generation, (2) a diverse set of seed datasets to provide context and variety, (3) state-of-the-art LLMs to perform generation, and (4) filtering to ensure quality. We employed three models from the Qwen2.5 family (qwen2025qwen25technicalreport): Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct for complex tasks, such as generating detailed reasoning traces for mathematical problems; Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct for intermediate tasks; and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for simpler generation tasks, such as producing structured summaries of low-quality web samples.

For seed data, we selected 15 diverse datasets spanning education, science, technology, law, literature, and general knowledge (including FineWeb-Edu, Cosmopedia-v2, FineMath, Wikipedia, LegalPT, CodeParrot, and others—see Appendix D for the complete list). Domain coverage in the final dataset includes educational texts, short academic articles, tutorials, WikiHow-style guides, blog posts, legal text summaries, mathematical walk-throughs with step-by-step reasoning, programming tutorials, philosophy articles, short stories, children’s stories, synthetic email exchanges, and extensive sequences of multiple-choice QA pairs. Because many evaluation benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice formats, we intentionally included a substantial volume of such data, as prior work has shown that exposure to this format can improve LLM performance on similarly framed tasks (kang2025demystifyingsyntheticdatallm; yang2024syntheticcontinuedpretraining).

##### Quality Filtering and Decontamination.

All samples were post-processed to ensure quality and avoid benchmark contamination. We implemented a decontamination method based on contiguous token-level -gram matching, rather than word-level n-grams, to detect overlaps between synthetic data and reference benchmark datasets. For each synthetic sample, we extracted all contiguous sequences of tokenizer output tokens (-grams) of length and checked their membership in a benchmark index constructed in the same token space; any samples flagged as non-members were removed. This approach is similar to that of muennighoff2025s1simpletesttimescaling. We also applied approximate matching in token space to account for minor variations (e.g., punctuation differences or single-token substitutions). Finally, we removed samples containing characters outside the Portuguese (Latin script) Unicode range, thereby ensuring high confidence that models did not drift into other languages.666It was common to find samples where models trailed off to write passages in Chinese.

##### Dataset Statistics.

The generation process spanned 4 months (January–June 2025) using 16 NVIDIA A40 GPUs distributed across two nodes, leveraging the vLLM library (kang2025demystifyingsyntheticdatallm) as our inference engine. We estimate approximately 48,000 GPU hours were consumed, corresponding to approximately 14,400 kWh of energy, yielding a carbon footprint of 5.3 metric tons of CO2e (see Section 10). The final GigaVerbo-v2 Synth dataset comprises 11,237,546 samples totaling approximately 9.3 billion tokens. Detailed statistics by generator and seed dataset are provided in Appendix D.

### 3.4 Data Ablation Study

To evaluate the quality of the different portions of our dataset, we conducted an ablation study to assess the downstream impact of these subsets on benchmark performance. More specifically, we prepared four different data mixtures:

-
1.
Edu: Consisting solely of the educational portion of our web-sourced corpus (samples with educational quality score 3).

-
2.
Synth: Consisting solely of our synthetic dataset.

-
3.
Edu+Synth: A combination of both the educational portion of our web-sourced corpus and our synthetic dataset.

-
4.
Non-Edu: Consisting solely of the non-educational portion of our web-sourced corpus (samples with educational quality score 3).


To measure the impact of each data mixture on model performance, we trained separate 1.5-billion-parameter language models on each dataset, using the same architecture and training hyperparameters across all runs. All models were trained on a total of 46 billion tokens, corresponding to a compute budget of approximately 4.141020 FLOPs. For the Edu+Synth mixture, we sampled from both datasets equally during training, ensuring the model saw 23 billion tokens from each subset. For the pure Synth mix, we had to repeat the entire dataset 5x. The model architecture, training hyperparameters, and detailed experimental configuration are provided in Appendix E.

For evaluation, we employed the easy set of our evaluation suite, which includes benchmarks such as ARC Challenge (clark2018thinksolvedquestionanswering), Calame (lopes2024gloriagenerativeopen), Global PIQA (chang2025globalpiqaevaluatingphysical), HellaSwag (zellers2019hellaswagmachinereallyfinish), and Lambada (lambada2016). These benchmarks were selected because they provide a good signal of model performance even at early training stages, allowing us to observe the impact of different data mixtures without requiring extensive training (see Section 5). We also include results from the Tucano models (correa2025tucanoadvancingneuraltext) for comparison, as they were trained on Portuguese data of a similar nature and provide multiple checkpoints at different training stages. To keep our comparison fair, we selected Tucano checkpoints with the closest training-token counts (52 billion) to our ablation models (46 billion).

Results show a significant improvement in downstream performance across benchmarks when compared to the first version of GigaVerbo. As illustrated in Figure 1, the Edu+Synth model achieves the best performance on ARC Challenge (34.4%), substantially outperforming the Non-Edu mixture (25.6%), and also surpassing both the Edu-only (32.8%) and Synth-only (32.6%) mixtures. Similar patterns emerge on HellaSwag, where the Edu+Synth mixture (46.0%) substantially outperforms the Non-Edu model (38.3%). On Global PIQA, the Edu-only mixture achieves the best performance (82.0%). On Lambada, the Edu+Synth mixture achieves the highest score (39.0%), followed closely by the Edu-only mixture (37.7%). Detailed per-benchmark plots and a comprehensive comparison table including other relevant models are provided in Appendix E.

Even with a much smaller compute budget (46B tokens) compared to other models (e.g., Curió seen 1 trillion tokens of pretraining and 150 billion tokens of continual pretraining, Llama-3.2-1B seen 9 trillion tokens of pretraining), the models trained on GigaVerbo-v2 and GigaVerbo-v2 Synth achieve competitive performance across all evaluated benchmarks (see Appendix E). In total, this ablation study involved training 4 separate 1.5 billion-parameter models for a total of 184 billion tokens, which translates to approximately 1.651021 FLOPs of compute. We estimate that the total energy consumed during these experiments was approximately 1,600 kWh, resulting in a carbon footprint of approximately 607 kg CO2e (see Section 10).

## 4 Tokenization

As previously noted in prior work (finardi2021berta; larcher2023cabrita; correa2024teenytinyllama), the efficiency of a tokenization scheme in compressing a given language directly affects the training cost of the corresponding language model. A tokenizer specifically tailored to a target domain can significantly reduce the number of tokens required to encode text (larcher2023cabrita; correa2024teenytinyllama), thereby reducing training time, inference latency, and computational costs.

Building on our previous experience with Portuguese-only tokenizers, we extended our focus to include a multilingual mixture of Portuguese, English, and code. This decision was motivated by our training mixture, which incorporates high-quality English and code data alongside Portuguese content (see Section 7). An efficient tokenizer that handles all three domains enables us to leverage these resources without introducing data outside our tokenizer’s domain.

### 4.1 Training Procedure

We trained our tokenizer using the SentencePiece library (kudo2018sentencepiece), an unsupervised text tokenizer that enables purely end-to-end systems without language-specific pre- or post-processing. SentencePiece is implemented in C++ with multi-threaded training support, allowing efficient processing of large-scale corpora. We constructed a training corpus with a 40-40-20 mixture of Portuguese, English, and code:

-
•
Portuguese: 2,000,000 text samples (sourced from GigaVerbo-v2).

-
•
English: 2,000,000 text samples (sourced from FineWeb Edu (penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb)).

-
•
Code: 975,000 text samples, covering 36 programming languages (sourced from the Starcoder dataset (li2023starcodersourceyou)).


The resulting tokenizer has a vocabulary size of 49,152 tokens and employs the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm, with SentencePiece normalization and boundary handling.

### 4.2 Evaluation Results

To assess tokenizer quality, we employ two standard metrics (rust2021goodtokenizermonolingualperformance):

-
•
Subword Fertility (SF): The average number of tokens per word. Lower values indicate more efficient encoding, with a theoretical minimum of 1.0 (each word is a single token).

-
•
Proportion of Continued Words (PCW): The ratio of words encoded with two or more tokens. Lower values indicate less aggressive word splitting.


We evaluated our tokenizer alongside several recent multilingual and Portuguese-adapted models on a corpus of 600,000 Portuguese words. Table 1 presents a summary of key results. Our Tucano 2 tokenizer achieves the lowest fertility (1.51) and highest compression efficiency (2.88 characters per token), outperforming all compared tokenizers. Detailed evaluation results on mixed (Portuguese, English, and code) data, as well as compute cost estimates based on fertility values, are provided in Appendix F.

| Model | Tokens | Vocab Size | SF | PCW | Chars/Token |
| Tucano2-0.6B-Base | 906,049 | 49,152 | 1.51 | 0.56 | 2.88 |
| GlorIA-1.3B | 950,349 | 50,258 | 1.58 | 0.47 | 3.04 |
| Llama-3.2-1B | 1,147,831 | 128,256 | 1.91 | 0.61 | 2.72 |
| SmolLM3-3B-Base | 1,147,831 | 128,256 | 1.91 | 0.61 | 2.72 |
| OLMo-2-0425-1B | 1,150,948 | 100,278 | 1.92 | 0.61 | 2.71 |
| Qwen3-0.6B | 1,155,951 | 151,669 | 1.93 | 0.61 | 2.68 |
| Curió-1.1b | 1,304,472 | 32,000 | 2.17 | 0.55 | 3.09 |
| Granite-3.3-2b-base | 1,371,057 | 49,152 | 2.29 | 0.63 | 2.52 |

Reduced fertility directly translates into computational savings. Using the compute estimation heuristics proposed by ali2024tokenizer, we estimate that training a -billion-parameter model (28 layers, hidden size 1,536, maximum sequence length 4,096, batch size 512) on 500 billion tokens with our tokenizer would require approximately FLOPs, compared to FLOPs for Qwen3’s tokenizer—a reduction of approximately 30%. These efficiency gains compound across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference, making our tokenizer a cost-effective option for Portuguese language modeling.

## 5 Evaluation Framework

### 5.1 Motivation

Evaluations guide LLM development by revealing model capabilities and learning progress (fourrier2025_the_llm_evaluation_guidebook). However, not all benchmarks provide equally reliable signals, particularly during pretraining. In our previous work with Tucano (correa2025tucanoadvancingneuraltext), we observed that certain Portuguese benchmarks exhibited minimal improvement as models were trained on more data, raising questions about their effectiveness for tracking pretraining progress.

To investigate this systematically, we analyze the widely used Portuguese evaluation suite developed by open-pt-llm-leaderboard, which includes nine benchmarks spanning exam-based question answering (ENEM, BLUEX, OAB), natural language inference (ASSIN2 RTE, FAQUAD NLI), semantic similarity (ASSIN2 STS), and classification (HateBR, PT Hate Speech, TweetSentBR). All benchmarks are implemented as generative tasks that require the model to produce free-form text responses. While this setting is appropriate for evaluating instruction-tuned models, free-form generation requires substantial latent knowledge and is often too challenging for models during short pretraining runs (fourrier2025_the_llm_evaluation_guidebook), especially in the early stages.

### 5.2 Signal Analysis

To quantify benchmark reliability, we evaluate SmolLM3-3b (bakouch2025smollm3), a 3-billion-parameter multilingual model trained on 11.5 trillion tokens—including Portuguese, albeit in a smaller and more diluted proportion—across multiple checkpoints from its training run. Following penedo2025fineweb2pipelinescale, we define three signal-quality metrics:

-
•
Mean Absolute Change: Average absolute difference between consecutive evaluation points. Measures step-to-step instability.

-
•
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Ratio of mean score to standard deviation. Higher values indicate that the signal dominates the noise.

-
•
Spearman Correlation: Correlation between benchmark scores and training steps. Higher positive values indicate the benchmark reliably tracks improvement.


We also adopt the Normalized Preferred Metric (NPM) from Pires_2023 to aggregate performance across benchmarks with different random baselines:

Our analysis reveals substantial challenges with the existing suite. For SmolLM3-3b, certain benchmarks require 755B–1T+ tokens before surpassing their baselines by 5% (Table G.14). Meanwhile, benchmarks like ASSIN2 RTE, FAQUAD NLI, HateBR, and TweetSentBR exhibit extremely high volatility. Only ENEM, BLUEX, and OAB exhibit reasonable signal-to-noise ratios ( 4) and strong Spearman correlations ( 0.8), but these still require substantial training budgets before yielding meaningful signals. Detailed per-benchmark plots and signal statistics are provided in Appendix G.1.

### 5.3 Portuguese Suite Construction

Motivated by these findings, we construct an improved Portuguese evaluation suite by integrating tasks from the LM-Evaluation-Harness (eval-harness) that have demonstrated reliable pretraining signals in prior work (Corr_a_2025). Unlike the generative-task-only design of open-pt-llm-leaderboard suite, we employ log-likelihood evaluations in two formats:

-
•
Multiple-Choice Format (MCF): Choices are explicitly presented in the prompt and prefixed with labels (e.g., A/B/C/D). Each candidate’s answer is scored using its conditional log-likelihood given the prompt, and the option with the highest log-likelihood is selected.

-
•
Cloze Formulation (CF): The model completes a passage by predicting the most likely continuation, without explicit choice labels. As in MCF, candidate completions are evaluated via their conditional log-likelihood under the model, and the continuation with the highest log-likelihood is chosen. CF tasks typically provide earlier learning signals than MCF tasks (fourrier2025_the_llm_evaluation_guidebook).


Our new suite includes: ARC Challenge (clark2018thinksolvedquestionanswering), ASSIN2 Entailment and Paraphrase (log-likelihood variants) (fonseca2016assin), Belebele (bandarkar-etal-2024-belebele), Calame (lopes2024gloriagenerativeopen), Global PIQA (chang2025globalpiqaevaluatingphysical), HellaSwag (zellers2019hellaswagmachinereallyfinish), LAMBADA (lambada2016), and MMLU (hendryckstest2021). All tasks are evaluated at a 5-shot regime.

Evaluating SmolLM3-3b on this suite yields substantial improvements in signal quality. Most benchmarks surpass their baselines within 94B–660B tokens (Table G.17), and the aggregated NPM score exhibits a clearer monotonic upward trend across checkpoints (Appendix G.2). Crucially, benchmarks such as ARC Challenge, Global PIQA, HellaSwag, LAMBADA, and Calame provide meaningful signals at 200B tokens, enabling cost-effective ablation studies.

The signal-quality analysis confirms these improvements: most benchmarks exhibit Spearman correlations 0.5, and CF tasks (Calame, HellaSwag, Global PIQA) achieve signal-to-noise ratios 20, substantially higher than MCF tasks such as Belebele and MMLU (SNR 7). Detailed statistics are provided in Appendix G.2.

### 5.4 Unified Suite Design

We combine the most reliable benchmarks from both groups into a unified two-tier evaluation suite:

-
•
Easy Set: ARC Challenge, Calame, Global PIQA, HellaSwag, LAMBADA. These benchmarks provide reliable signals at early training stages (200B tokens) with high signal-to-noise ratios (10) and strong Spearman correlations (0.57).

-
•
Hard Set: ENEM, BLUEX, OAB, Belebele, MMLU. These benchmarks require more training data ( 660B tokens) to demonstrate improvement, but they also provide complementary evaluation of advanced capabilities. All exhibit strong Spearman correlations (0.8) despite low signal-to-noise ratios (10).


This two-tier design enables researchers to track model progress efficiently during early pretraining (Easy Set) while also assessing advanced capabilities as training progresses (Hard Set). Comprehensive evaluation results and comparisons are provided in Appendix G.3.

### 5.5 Post-Training Evaluation

For assessing instruction-tuned models, we adapt four additional benchmarks:

##### IFEval-PT.

We manually translate and adapt 300 samples from the IFEval dataset (zhou2023instructionfollowingevaluationlargelanguage) into Portuguese, preserving multi-instruction complexity. The benchmark assesses whether models adhere to explicit formatting and content instructions (e.g., “write at least 6 paragraphs with a title in all caps”). We report both strict and loose accuracy at the prompt and instruction levels.

##### GSM8K-PT.

We translate the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (cobbe2021trainingverifierssolvemath) using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, followed by manual review and correction, yielding 1,295 Portuguese math problems. Evaluation uses exact-match scoring with both strict and flexible numeric extraction.

##### RULER-PT.

We adapt the RULER long-context benchmark (hsieh2024rulerwhatsrealcontext; kim2025rulermeasureallbenchmarking) to Portuguese, including needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) retrieval tasks, variable tracking, and common word extraction across multiple context lengths (1K–128K tokens). We leverage Portuguese texts from the OneRuler repository (kim2025rulermeasureallbenchmarking) for NIAH tasks.

##### HumanEval.

We evaluate code generation using the HumanEval benchmark (chen2021codex), following the original implementation provided in the LM-Evaluation-Harness. We simply adapt the instruction prompts to Portuguese while keeping the original problems, test cases, and evaluation protocol unchanged. All models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting, and performance is reported using pass@1.

All four benchmarks are implemented in the LM-Evaluation-Harness and are released openly. Implementation details and full task descriptions are provided in Appendix G.4.

## 6 Training Infrastructure

### 6.1 Hardware Infrastructure

Our training infrastructure is Marvin, a Tier 3 HPC cluster at the University of Bonn. The system comprises 32 A100 GPU nodes (480GB A100 per node, 128 GPUs total) optimized for highly scalable distributed training, and 24 A40 GPU nodes (848GB A40 per node, 192 GPUs total) for machine learning workloads. All nodes are interconnected via Mellanox InfiniBand NDR at 200Gb/s, enabling efficient collective communication for multi-node training. Data processing leveraged CPU nodes (Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapids, 48–96 cores per node) with up to 4TB RAM per node, while the 5.6PB Lustre file system provided high-throughput storage for datasets and checkpoints. Detailed hardware specifications, node configurations, and task-level resource allocations are provided in Appendix H.1.

### 6.2 Software Framework

Our software stack is built on PyTorch (paszke2019pytorch) and Hugging Face Transformers (wolf-etal-2020-transformers), ensuring compatibility with the broader open-source ecosystem. We employ two parallelism strategies depending on model size, Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP) li2020pytorchdistributedexperiencesaccelerating and Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) (zhao2023pytorchfsdpexperiencesscaling). For all models below the 3-billion-parameter threshold, we use DDP; for our 3.7-billion-parameter model, we employ FSDP.

We integrate several performance optimizations into our stack:

-
•
Mixed-precision training: BF16 reduces memory footprint and accelerates training without compromising stability. TF32 tensor cores further enhance GEMM throughput on NVIDIA Ampere GPUs (valero2023mixed).

-
•
FlashAttention2: This memory-efficient attention implementation (dao2023flashattention2fasterattentionbetter) reduces memory complexity from to for sequence length , achieving up to 73% of theoretical peak FLOPS on A100 GPUs.

-
•
Fused Triton kernels: We use the Liger Kernel library (hsu2025ligerkernel) for fused operations (RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, cross-entropy), yielding 20% higher throughput and 60% memory savings compared to standard PyTorch implementations.

-
•
Activation recomputation: Re-materialization (chen2016trainingdeepnetssublinear) trades computation for memory, enabling training with longer sequences, larger batch sizes, and bigger models.


Comprehensive details on our codebase, library integrations, distributed training strategies (DDP and FSDP), and performance-optimization implementations are provided in Appendix H.2.

### 6.3 Scaling Analysis

Scaling experiments on a 7B-parameter reference model demonstrate efficient multi-node scaling with our stack. Fixing the micro-batch size to 2 samples per GPU and using gradient accumulation to maintain a global batch size of 1024 samples (4M tokens), we observe a near-linear speedup from 4 nodes (16 GPUs) to 64 nodes (256 GPUs). At 64 nodes, the system processes 774K tokens/second, achieving 144 TFLOPS/GPU—approximately 46% of A100’s theoretical peak for mixed-precision training. Detailed experimental setup, scaling curves, throughput analysis, scaling efficiency metrics, and per-node configurations are provided in Appendix H.3. Training system configuration details, including software versions and FSDP/NCCL parameters, are also documented in Appendix H.3.

## 7 Pretraining

### 7.1 Model Architecture

For the pretrained model in the Tucano 2 series, we used the 0.6B-parameter architecture (Tucano2-0.6B-Base) as our primary experimental platform. This scale enables rapid experimentation while remaining comparable to baseline models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen3-0.6B-Base. Following our prior work with the original Tucano series (correa2025tucanoadvancingneuraltext), we maintain a Llama-based architecture (touvron2023llama) incorporating standard components: RMSnorm for normalization (zhang2019rootmeansquarelayer), RoPE positional embeddings (su2023roformerenhancedtransformerrotary), and SwiGLU activations (shazeer2020gluvariantsimprovetransformer).

Three principles guided our design choices: GPU efficiency, model expressiveness, and saturation resistance. All key dimensions (hidden size, intermediate size, vocabulary size) are aligned with GPU-friendly dimensions, thereby optimizing tensor operations and minimizing GPU under-utilization. We adopt a “deep and slim” configuration, consistent with findings that increasing depth (while keeping width moderate) enhances generalization in small-to-mid-sized transformers (liu2024mobilellmoptimizingsubbillionparameter; allal2025smollm2smolgoesbig; bakouch2025smollm3; warner2024smarterbetterfasterlonger). Finally, evidence from Pythia (biderman2023pythia) and Llama (touvron2023llama) suggests that models with more than 400M parameters continue to benefit from prolonged training without early saturation, thereby justifying our moderate parameter count and extended training budget. Complete architectural specifications are provided in Appendix I.1.

### 7.2 Optimization Strategy

Recent work on the Muon optimizer (MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-Schulz) (jordan2024muon) has shown promising results for LLM training, with anecdotal evidence from large-scale deployments (nanochat; kimiteam2026kimik2openagentic) and emerging empirical validation (liu2025muonscalablellmtraining; chang2025convergencemuon). Muon is designed as a drop-in replacement for Adam that can be applied selectively to different parameter groups, making it attractive for experimentation without full commitment to a new optimization strategy.

To assess Muon’s suitability for our setup, we conducted a small-scale pilot study comparing AdamW and AdamW+Muon on approximately 25 billion tokens. Both runs used a warmup-stable-decay (WSD) learning rate schedule (hagele2024scalinglawscomputeoptimaltraining) with 2,000 warmup steps, 9,000 stable steps, and approximately 1,000 cooldown steps (1-sqrt decay), matching the learning schedule of our planned pretraining recipe. We measured two gradient stability metrics: variability (coefficient of variation, ) and volatility (standard deviation of consecutive changes in the gradient norm). The AdamW+Muon configuration exhibited substantially lower volatility (0.077 vs. 0.191) and reduced variability (1.61 vs. 1.79), suggesting smoother optimization trajectories. Based on these preliminary results, we adopted AdamW+Muon for our full training recipe, applying Muon to attention and feed-forward weights while using AdamW for embeddings and normalization layers. Detailed ablation results and gradient norm plots are provided in Appendix I.2.

### 7.3 Training Configuration

We derive optimal hyperparameters using the empirical scaling laws from DeepSeek LLM (deepseekai2024deepseekllmscalingopensource), which relate compute budget () to batch size and learning rate via predictable power-law relationships. Using the adjusted DeepSeek formulation, we estimate our compute budget and apply the scaling heuristics to obtain a batch size of 2,097,152 tokens () and a maximum learning rate of for AdamW (and for Muon, following the 10 scaling recommended for this optimizer). Following recent best practices (olmo20252olmo2furious; bakouch2025smollm3), we exclude embeddings from weight decay to enhance training stability. We perform checkpointing every 5,000 optimization steps, enabling regular performance evaluation and flexible resumption. Complete hyperparameter settings and scaling law derivations are provided in Appendix I.3.

### 7.4 Training Recipe

Unlike the single-stage warmup-decay recipe used in our original Tucano experiments, we designed a three-stage training curriculum inspired by OLMo2 (olmo20252olmo2furious) and SmolLM (allal2025smollm2smolgoesbig; bakouch2025smollm3). Each stage employs a specific phase of the WSD learning rate schedule (hagele2024scalinglawscomputeoptimaltraining), progressively refining the data mixture to upsample higher-quality subsets. Throughout all stages, we maintain a Portuguese-dominant mixture (63% overall) and supplement with high-quality English educational content (FineWeb-Edu (penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb), FineMath), synthetic data (Cosmopedia-v2 (allal2024cosmopedia), GigaVerbo-v2 Synth), and reasoning-focused datasets (OpenScience, Big Reasoning Traces, Math Meta Reasoning Filtered). The total training volume is approximately 408 billion tokens, distributed across 195,000 optimization steps.

##### Stage 1 (Warmup+Stable):

100,000 steps, 292B tokens. The learning rate increases linearly over the first 2,000 steps to a peak, then remains constant for the remaining 98,000 steps. The data mixture comprises 61% Portuguese educational content (GigaVerbo-v2, education score 3, repeated 2) and 39% English content (30% FineWeb-Edu, 9% FineMath).

##### Stage 2 (Stable):

60,000 steps, 140B tokens. The learning rate remains stable at the peak value. The mixture becomes more diverse: 54% Portuguese web text (GigaVerbo-v2, education score 4, repeated 2), 14% Portuguese synthetic data (GigaVerbo-v2 Synth, repeated 2), 21% English synthetic data (Cosmopedia-v2), 10% English educational content (FineWeb-Edu), 8% reasoning traces (OpenScience, Big Reasoning Traces, Math Meta Reasoning), and 5% mathematical content (FineMath).

##### Stage 3 (1-sqrt Decay):

35,000 steps, 74B tokens. The learning rate is annealed from the peak value using a 1-sqrt decay schedule. We further increase Portuguese content to 75%: 36% web text (GigaVerbo-v2, education score 4) and 39% synthetic data (GigaVerbo-v2 Synth, repeated 3), complemented by 15% English reasoning traces and 10% English mathematical content. This final stage emphasizes the use of high-quality Portuguese data and reasoning capabilities.

The multi-stage design enables flexible checkpoint resumption and supports our ablation studies. Data mixture proportions and repetition factors were iteratively refined during early training by monitoring the aggregate NPM score on the Easy Set evaluations (Section 5). Complete per-stage data tables, token distributions, and mixing strategies are provided in Appendix I.4.

### 7.5 Results

##### Learning Curves.

The training run proceeded smoothly across all three stages, with no signs of gradient explosion, vanishing gradients, or overfitting. Figure 2 shows the pretraining loss curve, exhibiting the expected discontinuous jumps at stage transitions due to changes in data mixtures and associated differences in average cross-entropy. Similar behaviors have been observed in other multi-stage training setups (zhang2024tinyllamaopensourcesmalllanguage; apertus2025apertusdemocratizingopencompliant). Gradient norm analysis (Appendix I.5) confirms stable optimization dynamics throughout the entire training run.

##### Benchmark Performance.

We evaluated Tucano2-0.6B-Base at regular intervals (10B token checkpoints) using our two-tier evaluation suite (Section 5). On the Easy Set—which provides reliable signals at early training stages—the model exhibits steady improvement throughout training (Figure 3). The final checkpoint achieves an aggregate NPM score of 40.28, substantially outperforming Qwen3-0.6B-Base (26.41) and Qwen2.5-0.5B (18.70) despite using a much smaller Portuguese-specific training corpus. Notably, Tucano2-0.6B-Base surpasses other Portuguese models of comparable or larger size, including Curió-1.1B (39.16), Tucano-2b4 (33.55), and Curió-Edu-1B (34.77).

As expected, performance on the Hard Set—which requires 660B tokens to show meaningful improvement (Section 5)—remains close to random baselines. Nevertheless, when combining both Easy and Hard Set scores, Tucano2-0.6B-Base achieves a total average NPM of 20.64, outperforming Qwen2.5-0.5B (19.89), Curió-1.1B (19.23), Tucano-2b4 (17.88), and other Portuguese baselines (see Table 2 and Figure 4).

| Model | Total Avg. | Easy Set | Hard Set |
| Qwen3-0.6B-Base | 29.40 | 26.41 | 32.38 |
| Tucano2-0.6B-Base | 20.64 | 40.28 | 0.99 |
| Qwen2.5-0.5B | 19.89 | 18.70 | 21.09 |
| Curió-1.1B | 19.23 | 39.16 | |
| Tucano-2b4 | 17.88 | 33.55 | 2.20 |
| Curió-Edu-1B | 17.72 | 34.77 | 0.67 |
| Carvalho-pt-gl-1.3B | 12.54 | 26.75 | |

##### Efficiency and Environmental Impact.

Training Tucano2-0.6B-Base required approximately 1.471022 FLOPs across 195,000 steps, consuming 872.61 kWh of energy and resulting in an estimated carbon footprint of 332.42 kg CO2e (see Section 10). Compared to the original Tucano-2b4 model, which required 11,749 kWh and produced 4,475 kg CO2e, this represents a 92% reduction in both energy consumption and carbon emissions while achieving superior aggregate benchmark performance. Detailed per-benchmark learning curves are provided in Appendix I.6.

### 7.6 Toward Continual Pretraining

While our pretraining recipe has yielded substantial improvements—particularly on the Easy Set evaluations—it also highlights a clear limitation: certain capabilities of interest for Portuguese LLMs (e.g., advanced reasoning, exam-based question answering) do not emerge unless the model is trained on substantially larger volumes of high-quality data. As demonstrated in Section 5, benchmarks in the Hard Set require 660B–1T+ tokens before showing meaningful signals (for a 3B parameter model). This volume is difficult to reach for low-resource languages when computational resources are constrained.

To bridge this capability gap, continual pretraining—adapting larger multilingual base models to Portuguese using our curated datasets—represents a promising direction for future work. This approach has been extensively explored in the Portuguese NLP literature (Pires_2023; almeida2024sabia2newgenerationportuguese; almeida2025buildinghighqualitydatasetsportuguese), though with varying degrees of success. While models like Sabiá and Curió have reported significant performance gains, other efforts have shown only modest improvements or even performance degradation on certain tasks (cruzcastaneda2025amadeusverbotechnicalreportpowerful; gaia-gemma-3-4b-2025). These mixed results suggest that continual pretraining is not guaranteed to succeed when applied naively, and that careful design of data mixtures, learning rate schedules, and training duration is critical for effective adaptation.

## 8 Continual Pretraining

### 8.1 Motivation

While our multi-stage training recipe for Tucano2-0.6B-Base yields strong Easy Set performance (Section 7), Hard Set capabilities—such as advanced reasoning and exam-based question answering—require training volumes exceeding 660B–1T tokens (Section 5), a scale difficult to achieve from scratch for low-resource languages under constrained compute budgets. Continual pretraining offers a pragmatic alternative: by adapting strong multilingual base models to the target domain, one can leverage the rich representations already learned during large-scale pretraining while focusing adaptation effort on Portuguese (ke2023continualpretraininglanguagemodels).

We select the Qwen3 series (Base versions) as our starting point for three reasons. First, Qwen3 models consistently outperform other similarly sized baselines on our evaluation suite, particularly on Hard Set benchmarks (Section 7). Second, all Qwen3 models within our target size range are released under the Apache-2.0 license, enabling unrestricted modification and redistribution. Third, the Qwen3 architecture covers a broad parameter range, enabling a family of Portuguese-adapted models at multiple scales.

However, the Qwen3 series employs a vocabulary of 151K tokens—approximately three times that of our Portuguese-optimized tokenizer (Section 4). This large, multilingual vocabulary introduces significant inefficiencies for Portuguese-focused tasks: many tokens are irrelevant to Portuguese, inflating memory consumption during training and reducing inference throughput. We address this challenge by transplanting the tokenizer, replacing the Qwen3 vocabulary with our more efficient tokenizer while preserving the pretrained weights.

### 8.2 Tokenizer Transplantation (OMP)

We adopt the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) approach to training-free tokenizer transplantation (goddard2025trainingfreetokenizertransplantationorthogonal). OMP is a greedy sparse approximation algorithm that reconstructs each donor-model embedding as a -sparse linear combination of shared-token embeddings, then transfers the same coefficients to the target model’s embedding space. Because pretrained LLM embedding spaces are approximately orthogonally aligned on shared tokens, these coefficients transfer meaningfully, preserving geometric and semantic structure without requiring gradient updates.

Using the mergekit-tokensurgeon utility (goddard2025arceesmergekittoolkitmerging), we transplant our 49K-token Portuguese-optimized tokenizer into three Qwen3 base models (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B). The vocabulary reduction from 151K to 49K removes approximately 68% of embedding parameters, yielding the Tucano2-qwen models: Tucano2-qwen-0.5B-Base (from Qwen3-0.6B-Base), Tucano2-qwen-1.5B-Base (from Qwen3-1.7B-Base), and Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Base (from Qwen3-4B-Base). Post-transplantation evaluation reveals that the adapted models retain substantial performance on Hard Set benchmarks while exhibiting expected degradation on language-modeling-sensitive Easy Set tasks. Detailed transplantation results are provided in Appendix J.1.

### 8.3 Training Configuration

Since continual pretraining adapts existing pretrained weights, hyperparameter selection requires careful balancing between adaptation and knowledge preservation. Following heuristics from the literature (parmar2024reusedontretrainrecipe; wang2024learningratepathswitching), we set peak learning rates at a fraction of the inferred original pretraining rates, with values determined through systematic sweeps of 10,000 steps (10.4B tokens each). We adopt AdamW with a simple warmup-cosine-decay schedule, as small-scale experiments with the AdamW+Muon variant used for Tucano2-0.6B-Base yielded inferior performance—likely due to an optimizer-state mismatch with the Qwen3 pretrained weights.

All models use a total batch size of 1,048,576 tokens (reduced from the 2M used during from-scratch pretraining to accommodate budget constraints) and a maximum context length of 4,096 tokens. Peak learning rates decrease with model size: (0.5B), (1.5B), and (3.7B). Training budgets range from 50B tokens (0.5B and 3.7B) to 100B tokens (1.5B), representing 0.3% of the original Qwen3 pretraining volume. Complete hyperparameter tables are provided in Appendix J.2.

### 8.4 Data Mixtures

Unlike the multilingual mixtures used during from-scratch pretraining, continual pretraining employs purely Portuguese data. This deliberate shift maximizes Portuguese-specific adaptation within the constrained compute budget. Each mixture combines curated web text from GigaVerbo-v2 (education score 4) with synthetic data from GigaVerbo-v2 Synth, maintaining a web-to-synthetic ratio of approximately 60:40 for the 0.5B and 3.7B models and 70:30 for the 1.5B model. Full data mixture compositions are provided in Appendix J.3.

### 8.5 Results

Table 3 presents aggregate results across our evaluation suite. The continual pretraining strategy produces consistent, substantial gains across all model scales.

| Model | Total Avg. | Easy Set | Hard Set |
| Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Base | 59.21 | 57.41 | 61.00 |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 57.97 | 54.12 | 61.83 |
| Qwen3-4B-Base | 57.86 | 52.52 | 63.20 |
| SmolLM3-3B-Base | 50.25 | 54.06 | 46.44 |
| Qwen2.5-3B | 50.16 | 47.69 | 52.62 |
| Tucano2-qwen-1.5B-Base | 47.90 | 47.97 | 47.82 |
| Curió-Edu-7B | 45.66 | 57.46 | 33.87 |
| Qwen3-1.7B-Base | 44.48 | 40.94 | 48.03 |
| Curió-7B | 42.79 | 58.97 | 26.60 |
| Llama-3.2-3B | 40.50 | 43.79 | 37.21 |
| Granite-3.3-2B | 39.97 | 45.31 | 34.63 |
| Tucano2-qwen-0.5B-Base | 35.36 | 39.93 | 30.79 |
| Qwen3-0.6B-Base | 29.40 | 26.41 | 32.38 |
| Tucano2-0.6B-Base | 20.64 | 40.28 | 0.99 |
| Qwen2.5-0.5B | 19.89 | 18.70 | 21.09 |

At the largest scale, Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Base achieves the highest total average NPM (59.21), surpassing both Qwen3-4B-Base (57.86) and even Qwen2.5-7B (57.97), a model with nearly twice the parameters. At the 1.5B scale, Tucano2-qwen-1.5B-Base (NPM: 47.90) improves by +3.42 points over Qwen3-1.7B-Base (44.48) and substantially outperforms domain-adapted models of comparable or larger size, such as Curió-7B (42.79) and Curió-Edu-7B (45.66). At the smallest scale, Tucano2-qwen-0.5B-Base (NPM: 35.36) achieves a +5.96-point improvement over Qwen3-0.6B-Base (29.40) while dramatically outperforming Tucano2-0.6B-Base (20.64).

### 8.6 Compute-Performance Tradeoff

Figure 6 plots aggregate NPM against total compute (, where is the parameter count and is the total number of tokens processed, including both pretraining and continual pretraining). These results underscore the cost-effectiveness of continual pretraining as a strategy for adapting strong multilingual foundations to low-resource languages: rather than training from scratch, a modest additional investment on top of a well-pretrained base yields substantial gains. A detailed breakdown of compute for all models is provided in Appendix J.5.

## 9 Post-Training

After developing our base models, we proceed to the post-training phase, which comprises two stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO). SFT enhances instruction-following capabilities by fine-tuning on a large, diverse set of instruction-response pairs in Portuguese. PO further refines alignment by explicitly capturing both quality-focused (helpfulness and reasoning) and safety-focused (refusal and risk mitigation) signals.

### 9.1 GigaVerbo-v2 SFT

##### Task taxonomy.

We define a comprehensive taxonomy of 12 task types: code generation, function calling, general instruction following, mathematical problem solving, mathematical problem solving with chain-of-thought (CoT), reasoning (with explicit <think></think> traces), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), rewriting, structured output generation (JSON), summarization, system prompts, and translation. This taxonomy is designed to prepare models for a broad range of downstream applications.

##### Dataset construction.

Prompts were sourced from multiple public instruction-tuning datasets in English and Portuguese, with all English content translated to Portuguese using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Responses were generated synthetically using the Qwen2.5 model family, with model capacity matched to task complexity: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct for simpler tasks (summarization, rewriting, translation) and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct for complex tasks (reasoning, Math CoT). For reasoning-intensive tasks, we employed a two-stage pipeline: (1) Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct generated initial direct responses, then (2) Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct produced detailed reasoning traces appended in <think></think> format. A key finding during this process is that generating high-quality reasoning traces in Portuguese remains challenging. Experiments with Qwen3 and SmolLM3 revealed that these models frequently default to English during reasoning, produce inconsistent reasoning that trails off without conclusions, or switch languages mid-generation. This motivated our use of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and highlights an important ecosystem gap that our Think models aim to address.

##### Quality filtering.

Since GigaVerbo-v2 SFT is entirely LLM-generated, we implemented a dedicated quality filtering pipeline. We first annotated 500K randomly sampled interactions using an LLM-as-a-judge prompt (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct scoring instruction adherence on a 1–5 scale) (see Section A), then fine-tuned Qwen3-4B-Base into a regression-based quality classifier, achieving F1-macro of 0.80 (F1 of 0.98 at the 3 acceptability threshold) (see Section K for details on the training o these annotators). Samples scoring below 3.5 were removed, followed by benchmark decontamination and language filtering. The resulting dataset comprises 4.1M examples (2.15B tokens); full statistics are in Table 4.

| Subset | Samples | Tokens |
| Retrieval | 1,977,667 | 1,013,172,488 |
| General | 1,235,976 | 700,483,545 |
| Math | 220,042 | 83,234,218 |
| Structured | 163,542 | 70,632,221 |
| Summarization | 128,669 | 90,310,108 |
| Code | 80,774 | 84,389,567 |
| Reasoning | 78,249 | 34,786,173 |
| Math CoT | 63,413 | 27,107,305 |
| Function Call | 45,891 | 28,712,972 |
| Translation | 45,204 | 7,877,426 |
| Rewriting | 29,150 | 3,674,384 |
| System Prompts | 20,512 | 7,261,615 |
| Total | 4,089,089 | 2,151,642,022 |

Notably, reasoning samples constitute 2% of the total, a direct consequence of the high cost and quality challenges described above. This imbalance motivated our decision to train separate Instruct and Think models rather than a single hybrid model (Section 9.3).

### 9.2 GigaVerbo-v2 Preferences

To further align our models, we construct a preference dataset that spans both quality- and safety-focused alignment objectives. Prompts were sourced from UltraFeedback (diverse instruction-following) and HarmfulQA (adversarial/NSFW prompts), covering two core alignment challenges: (1) benign requests requiring helpful, well-reasoned responses, and (2) harmful requests requiring consistent refusal behavior.

Response generation followed a Constitutional AI approach with distinct constitutions for each subset. For the harmless subset, chosen responses were generated by Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct with chain-of-thought reasoning, while rejected responses came from Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. For the harmful subset, chosen (refusal) responses used safety-oriented constitutions applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, while rejected (compliant) responses were generated by an abliterated variant of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct (arditi2024refusallanguagemodelsmediated). After decontamination and quality filtering, the final dataset contains 28K preference pairs (28M tokens), with a balanced split between reasoning and non-reasoning formats. URLs to the used constitutions are provided in Appendix L.3 and L.4.

### 9.3 Training Configuration

Each base model (0.5B, 1.5B, 3.7B) was used to produce two chat variants:

-
•
Instruct: trained on the full multi-task GigaVerbo-v2 SFT mixture + the non-reasoning part of GigaVerbo-v2 Preferences.

-
•
Think: trained exclusively on reasoning-intensive tasks from both our post-training datasets.


Both variants follow a two-stage recipe: SFT with assistant-only loss masking (5 epochs, context length 4,096, AdamW with cosine schedule), followed by Anchored Preference Optimization (doosterlinck2024anchoredpreferenceoptimizationcontrastive) using the apo_zero loss with (5 epochs). Full hyperparameter tables are provided in Appendix L.5.

### 9.4 Results

#### 9.4.1 Instruct Variants

Table 5 compares the Instruct variants against chat models of similar size across three evaluation dimensions: Knowledge & Reasoning (ARC-Challenge, ENEM, BLUEX, OAB Exams, BELEBELE, MMLU, GSM8K-PT), Instruction Following (IFEval-PT), and Coding (HumanEval).

| Total Avg. | K&R (NPM) | Instruct | Coding | |
| Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Instruct | 53.64 | 56.22 | 41.67 | 47.56 |
| Jurema-7B | 53.03 | 50.66 | 47.00 | 75.61 |
| Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct | 51.71 | 47.34 | 63.33 | 70.73 |
| Qwen3-4B | 51.36 | 42.33 | 79.33 | 86.59 |
| Gemma-3-Gaia-PT-BR-4b-it | 49.93 | 45.00 | 70.33 | 64.02 |
| SmolLM3-3B | 49.54 | 43.99 | 69.67 | 68.29 |
| Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct | 45.82 | 43.08 | 62.67 | 48.17 |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | 41.39 | 40.25 | 42.00 | 48.78 |
| Tucano2-qwen-1.5B-Instruct | 37.54 | 39.61 | 34.33 | 26.22 |
| Qwen3-1.7B | 36.30 | 28.24 | 65.00 | 64.02 |
| Tucano2-qwen-0.5B-Instruct | 26.08 | 27.77 | 30.00 | 10.37 |
| Qwen3-0.6B | 22.21 | 15.13 | 55.00 | 39.02 |
| Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct | 20.14 | 15.37 | 44.33 | 29.27 |
| Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct | 17.8 | 14.98 | 31 | 24.39 |

Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Instruct achieves the highest Total Average (53.64) and the highest Knowledge & Reasoning score (56.22) among all models in the 3–4B range, surpassing Qwen3-4B (42.33), SmolLM3-3B (43.99), and the Portuguese-specialized Gemma-3-Gaia-PT-BR-4b-it (45.00). These gains span multiple domain-specific benchmarks, like BLUEX, ENEM, OAB, ARC-Challenge, BELEBELE, and MMLU. Mathematical reasoning is a particular strength: on GSM8K-PT, Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Instruct scores 53.81, outperforming both Qwen3-4B (39.88) and Gemma-3-Gaia-PT-BR-4b-it (51.29).

However, Tucano2 models lag behind on Instruction Following (IFEval-PT) and Coding (HumanEval), where models such as Qwen3-4B (79.33 IF, 86.59 Code) maintain clear advantages. This gap reflects limitations in our data mixture. For instance, GigaVerbo-v2 SFT does not contain samples designed to ”benchmax” IFEval-style prompts, and has a limited volume of coding-specific training samples (4%). Figure 7 presents per-benchmark comparisons for the 3.7B Instruct model; comparisons at other scales are provided in Appendix L.7.

#### 9.4.2 Think Variants

Table 6 compares the Think variants against reasoning models of similar size. Coding benchmarks are excluded because our Think models were not trained on coding data post-training.

| Total Avg. | K&R (NPM) | Instruct | |
| Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Think | 51.27 | 54.07 | 31.67 |
| SmolLM3-3B | 48.58 | 46.28 | 64.67 |
| Qwen3-4B | 46.35 | 40.97 | 84.00 |
| Qwen3-1.7B | 36.54 | 32.00 | 68.33 |
| Tucano2-qwen-1.5B-Think | 27.54 | 26.67 | 33.67 |
| Qwen3-0.6B | 24.11 | 19.22 | 58.33 |
| Tucano2-qwen-0.5B-Think | 14.41 | 12.52 | 27.67 |

Despite training on substantially less reasoning data and operating under a constrained 4,096-token context window (roughly half the inference budget used to evaluate the competing models), Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Think achieves the highest Knowledge & Reasoning NPM (54.07), surpassing both Qwen3-4B (40.97) and SmolLM3-3B (46.28) on benchmarks including OAB, ARC-Challenge, BELEBELE, and MMLU—while reasoning entirely in Portuguese.

We noticed that the evaluated reasoning models underperform on certain evaluation metrics, such as IFEval-PT and HumanEval (see Appendix L.7.3). This is consistent with the specialization trade-off: reasoning models optimize for extended chain-of-thought problem-solving rather than format-adherent instruction-following. Figure 8 presents per-benchmark comparisons for the 3.7B Think model.

#### 9.4.3 Long-Context Evaluation

We evaluated all post-trained models on RULER-PT at context lengths of 1,024, 2,048, and 4,096 tokens. Tucano2 models fall substantially behind Qwen3 counterparts across all lengths, with the gap widening at longer contexts (Table 7). We attribute this primarily to the absence of long-context reasoning and retrieval samples in our SFT and preference data—tasks such as multi-key KV retrieval and common word extraction require robust long-range attention that must be explicitly cultivated during training. Addressing this limitation through long-context data augmentation and potential extensions of context length is a priority for future work. Detailed per-task RULER breakdowns are provided in Appendix L.7.4.

| Model | 1024 | 2048 | 4096 |
| Qwen3-4B | 0.966 | 0.984 | 0.979 |
| Qwen3-1.7B | 0.977 | 0.930 | 0.961 |
| Qwen3-0.6B | 0.924 | 0.861 | 0.885 |
| Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Think | 0.817 | 0.765 | 0.707 |
| Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Instruct | 0.795 | 0.710 | 0.686 |
| Tucano2-qwen-1.5B-Think | 0.603 | 0.501 | 0.440 |
| Tucano2-qwen-1.5B-Instruct | 0.573 | 0.494 | 0.421 |
| Tucano2-qwen-0.5B-Instruct | 0.607 | 0.481 | 0.382 |
| Tucano2-qwen-0.5B-Think | 0.471 | 0.364 | 0.293 |

## 10 Resource Consumption

### 10.1 Energy and Carbon Analysis

In Table 8, we summarize the estimated energy consumption and carbon footprint for each phase of the project, as reported by CodeCarbon (codecarbon). All projected carbon emissions estimates used the average energy grid carbon intensity for North Rhine-Westphalia (0.38 kg CO2e/kWh), Germany.

| Phase | Energy (kWh) | Carbon (kg CO2e) |
| GigaVerbo-v2 Synth (data generation) | 14,400 | 5,472 |
| Continual Pretraining | 2,326 | 884 |
| GigaVerbo-v2 Ablations | 1,600 | 608 |
| Evaluations (all models) | 1,000 | 380 |
| Post-Training (SFT + PO) | 530 | 201 |
| Pretraining | 873 | 332 |
| Total (tracked) | 20,729 | 7,877 |

### 10.2 Resource Consumption Beyond Carbon

Training AI models not only consumes energy during computation but also requires substantial material resources for manufacturing the training hardware, in this case, NVIDIA A100 SXM GPUs. Based on the material composition of the GPUs, their assumed operational lifespan, and the model FLOP utilization achieved during training runs, the share of hardware-related resource consumption attributable to each training run can be estimated. Using the mineral composition analysis reported in falk2025morethancarbon and the FLOP-based resource allocation methodology introduced in falk2025flops, we estimate the aggregated material footprint of all training runs in the Tucano 2 series. This includes all pre-training and post-training runs across all model sizes (see Table 9).

| Family | Params | Base | Instruct | Think |
| Tucano2-0.6 | 670M | 408B | – | – |
| Tucano2-qwen-0.5 | 490M | 50B | 4.5B | 250M |
| Tucano2-qwen-1.5 | 1.5B | 100B | 4.5B | 250M |
| Tucano2-qwen-3.7 | 3.7B | 50B | 4.5B | 250M |

Using an average MFU of 60%, assuming a GPU lifespan of three years, and training performed on NVIDIA A100 SXM GPUs, the total material footprint across all 10 training runs (covering all Base, Instruct, and Think models) amounts to 0.307 kg of copper, followed by 0.010 kg of iron, kg of tin, kg of silicon, and kg of nickel. Smaller amounts include aluminum, calcium, chromium, and barium, while all remaining elements are below the mg scale. Copper clearly dominates the overall elemental footprint, primarily due to its large share in the heatsink.

For three of our base models, we use Qwen3 as a foundation (Qwen3-0.6B-Base, Qwen3-1.7B-Base, Qwen3-4B-Base). Taking the aggregated mineral resource consumption of these three base models into account as well would add an additional 105.63 kg of copper, 3.49 kg of iron, 1.56 kg of tin, 1.03 kg of silicon, and 0.85 kg of nickel — increasing the total footprint by roughly two orders of magnitude relative to the development of our models.

These estimates account only for the material content of the manufactured accelerators and do not include additional resource losses occurring during raw material extraction, processing, manufacturing, or production waste, and should therefore be interpreted as lower-bound estimates.

### 10.3 Sustainability Discussion

The resource accounting above surfaces several points relevant to sustainability in LLM research.

##### Synthetic data generation dominates total cost.

Over 69% of all tracked energy was consumed during the construction of GigaVerbo-v2 Synth, i.e., generating responses at scale with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. This highlights a structural tension in the current paradigm: while synthetic data enables high-quality supervision without expensive human annotation, inference at a billion-parameter scale is itself a significant compute sink. Future work should prioritize low-cost generation strategies—such as those proposed by maini2025beyondweb—to reduce this overhead.

##### Continual pretraining is a compute-efficient path to strong performance.

The entire Tucano-qwen family (three model scales, 50–100B tokens each) was trained for 2,326 kWh, which is only 2.7 the cost of training the 670M Tucano2-0.6B-Base from scratch. Given that the 3.7B Tucano-qwen models surpass substantially larger baselines on Portuguese benchmarks (Section 8), continual pretraining with tokenizer transplantation is a promising, energy-efficient strategy for language adaptation.

##### These estimates are a lower bound.

CodeCarbon tracks only GPU device power draw during instrumented runs. Energy consumed by CPU-only preprocessing pipelines (tokenization, deduplication, quality filtering), cluster interconnects, storage I/O, cooling infrastructure, and idle reservation periods is not reflected in Table 8. The actual carbon footprint of this work is therefore higher than reported, and we encourage future work to adopt whole-system energy auditing where possible. In addition, these estimates exclude embodied carbon emissions outside the use phase, i.e., emissions that arise from raw material extraction, component manufacturing, transportation, and end-of-life disposal.

##### Contextualising the carbon footprint.

The total tracked footprint of 7,900 kg CO2e is comparable to roughly 2–3 transatlantic round-trip flights per person and is several orders of magnitude lower than the reported costs of training frontier models. For instance, the energy consumption for Llama 4 during training is estimated at 7.38 million GPU hours of computation, which translates to approximately 1,999 tons of CO2e emissions (arxiv2026llama4herdarchitecture). While this does not diminish the responsibility to minimize unnecessary computation, it illustrates that targeted, linguistically-motivated model development can be conducted at a comparatively modest environmental cost, particularly when training is co-located with low-carbon energy grids.

## 11 Conclusion

In this work, we presented Tucano 2, a fully open suite of Portuguese large language models spanning 0.5B to 3.5B parameters, accompanied by the complete stack of artifacts required for reproducible development: large-scale pretraining corpora (GigaVerbo-v2, GigaVerbo-v2 Synth), annotation and filtering models, supervised fine-tuning and preference datasets (GigaVerbo-v2 SFT, GigaVerbo-v2 Preferences), a Portuguese evaluation suite, and all training recipes and code—released under permissive licenses. Our pretraining and continual pretraining strategies demonstrate that carefully curated, language-specific data pipelines and efficient tokenization can yield models that outperform or match multilingual baselines. In particular, Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Instruct achieves the highest Knowledge & Reasoning score among all models in the 3–4B parameter range, while Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Think produces chain-of-thought reasoning entirely in Portuguese, a capability largely absent from prior open Portuguese models. Together, these contributions narrow persistent gaps in Portuguese NLP and provide a concrete, reproducible blueprint for community-driven LLM development in low-resource languages.

##### Limitations and Future Work.

Despite these advances, several limitations point toward important directions for future research. First, our synthetic data generation pipeline, while effective, accounted for the largest share of total energy consumption (73%), underscoring the need for more efficient, scalable generation methods that reduce costs without sacrificing diversity. Second, our post-training pipeline relies on SFT followed by Anchored Preference Optimization, but the preference dataset (GigaVerbo-v2 Preferences) remains relatively small (28K pairs). Scaling preference data by an order of magnitude and investigating reinforcement learning–based post-training methods—such as GRPO and other reward-driven optimization frameworks—could substantially improve alignment quality, particularly for reasoning and agentic capabilities. Moreover, introducing a “mid-training” stage that targets areas where we currently lack (e.g., long-context reasoning, code generation) could be an effective step before returning to post-training, as demonstrated by previous studies (howard2018universallanguagemodelfinetuning; faircodegenteam2025cwmopenweightsllmresearch; xu2025phi4minireasoningexploringlimitssmall; bakouch2025smollm3).

Looking ahead, we identify several high-impact opportunities. On the data side, developing more diverse and challenging SFT samples—especially for multi-step reasoning, structured output generation, and tool use—would further close the gap to frontier models. Expanding the volume and diversity of reasoning-focused training data, including both native Portuguese and carefully translated mathematical and scientific corpora, is critical for advancing reasoning capabilities. Context extension techniques and the construction of high-quality long-context samples for post-training represent another promising axis, given the increasing importance of long-horizon tasks in practical applications. Finally, designing datasets and training protocols tailored for agentic settings—including multi-turn user–agent interactions, long-horizon planning, and dynamic tool orchestration—would position Portuguese LLMs to participate in the next wave of autonomous AI systems. We hope that the open release of all artifacts produced in this work will lower barriers to entry and catalyze sustained, community-driven progress for Portuguese and other low-resource languages.

### E.2 Detailed Results

Figure E.4 presents per-benchmark performance comparisons across the four data mixtures and the Tucano-2b4 baseline.

##### ARC Challenge.

ARC is perhaps where we observe the most pronounced differences among data mixtures. The Edu+Synth model achieves a score (34.4%) that substantially outperforms the Non-Edu mixture (25.6%), and also surpasses both the Edu-only (32.8%) and Synth-only (32.6%) mixtures.

##### Calame.

For Calame, which focuses on predicting the last word of a passage, we see a less pronounced advantage from the Edu portion of GigaVerbo-v2. We hypothesize that this is due to the nature of the benchmark, which may not benefit as much from educational content as other benchmarks focused on reasoning or commonsense understanding.

##### Global PIQA.

On Global PIQA, we observe that the addition of synthetic data to the educational portion of GigaVerbo-v2 yields a decrease in performance (75.0% vs 82.0%). However, both models still significantly outperform the Non-Edu model (65.0%). Given that the synthetic data was not specifically tailored for physical commonsense reasoning tasks (or cultural knowledge tasks in general), this result is not entirely surprising. It does, however, highlight some shortcomings of our synthetic dataset that we aim to address in future iterations.

##### HellaSwag.

HellaSwag is yet another benchmark where the Edu+Synth mixture outperforms the Non-Edu model by a significant margin (46.0% vs 38.3%), and the Edu-only mixture by a smaller margin (46.0% vs 44.9%). This reinforces the finding that educational and synthetic data jointly improve performance on commonsense reasoning tasks.

##### Lambada.

Lambada is the only benchmark where the Non-Edu mixture outperforms the Synth-only mixture (35.2% vs 33.9%). However, the Edu+Synth mixture still achieves the best performance (39.0%), followed closely by the Edu-only mixture (37.7%). Again, we hypothesize that this is due to the nature of the benchmark, which focuses on predicting the last word of a passage, a task that may not benefit as much from the repetitive patterns found in our synthetic corpus.

### E.3 Baseline Comparison

Table E.9 presents a comparison of the ablation models with other relevant Portuguese and multilingual baselines. Models are ranked by Normalized Performance Metric (NPM) (Pires_2023) (see Section 5), computed as the average of normalized scores across all five benchmarks.

| GlorIA-1.3B | 50,258 | 1.87 | 0.53 | 2.73 |
| granite-3.3-2b-base | 49,152 | 1.91 | 0.48 | 2.86 |

### F.3 Computational Cost Analysis

The reduced computational cost of our tokenizer yields substantial computational savings during training. Following the compute-estimation methodology of ali2024tokenizer, we estimate the FLOPs required to train a model under a fixed token budget of 500 billion tokens. The compute cost is approximated as:

| (1) |

where:

-
•
is the total computational cost (in FLOPs) to train on a given token count,

-
•
is the number of transformer layers,

-
•
is the hidden (embedding) dimension of the model,

-
•
is the input sequence length,

-
•
is the vocabulary size, and

-
•
is the total number of tokens in the training dataset.


The expression inside the parentheses in Equation equation 1 decomposes the per-token cost into three components:

-
1.
The constant term captures the dominant cost of the feed-forward network and the attention projection matrices within each layer, which scales as .

-
2.
The term accounts for the self-attention mechanism (i.e., the and attention-value products), whose cost grows linearly with the sequence length relative to the hidden size .

-
3.
The term represents the cost of the input embedding and output (unembedding) projection to the vocabulary, which is amortised across layers and scales with the vocabulary size .


The leading factor of arises from the combined cost of the forward and backward passes (approximately the forward pass cost) applied to the matrix multiplications within each layer ali2024tokenizer. Note that the batch size cancels when converting from the per-step cost to the per-token cost , making independent of the training batch configuration.

Table F.12 summarizes the estimated compute costs for training a model (28 layers, hidden size 1,536, maximum sequence length 4,096, batch size 512) on 500 billion tokens using different tokenizers. Our tokenizer requires approximately FLOPs, compared to FLOPs for Qwen3 and FLOPs for Granite, corresponding to compute savings of roughly 30% and 34%, respectively. These reductions compound across multiple training runs, ablation studies, and continual pretraining phases, highlighting the importance of tokenizer efficiency in resource-constrained research scenarios.

### G.4 Post-Training Evaluation Details

#### G.4.1 IFEval-PT

We manually translated and adapted 300 samples from the original IFEval dataset (zhou2023instructionfollowingevaluationlargelanguage) into Portuguese.

Table G.21 describes the four evaluation metrics provided by IFEval-PT.

| Metric | Description |
| prompt_level_strict_acc | Strict prompt accuracy: True only if all instructions are followed exactly with no formatting flexibility. |
| inst_level_strict_acc | Strict instruction accuracy: Checks each instruction separately with exact matching. |
| prompt_level_loose_acc | Loose prompt accuracy: Like strict prompt accuracy, but allows minor formatting variations. |
| inst_level_loose_acc | Loose instruction accuracy: Per-instruction check using loose (format-tolerant) matching. |

#### G.4.2 GSM8K-PT

We translated the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (cobbe2021trainingverifierssolvemath) using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, followed by manual review and correction, yielding 1,295 Portuguese math problems. The evaluation is performed via exact-match scoring with two extraction methods:

-
•
strict-match: Extracts numbers only from a required format tag (e.g., “#### 42”).

-
•
flexible-extract: Uses any detected number in the output as the answer, providing more lenient matching.


#### G.4.3 RULER-PT

We adapted the RULER long-context benchmark (hsieh2024rulerwhatsrealcontext; kim2025rulermeasureallbenchmarking) to Portuguese, including needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) retrieval tasks, variable tracking, and common word extraction across multiple context lengths (1K–128K tokens). Table G.22 describes each task.

| Task | Category | Description |
| niah_pt_single_1 | Retrieval (NIAH) | Find a hidden key/value pair embedded in random tokens. |
| niah_pt_single_2 | Retrieval (NIAH) | Recover a key/value pair embedded in natural Portuguese text. |
| niah_pt_single_3 | Retrieval (NIAH) | Complex retrieval: values are long/random; exact match required. |
| niah_pt_multikey_1 | Retrieval (NIAH) | Retrieve the correct value for a queried key (simple). |
| niah_pt_multikey_2 | Retrieval (NIAH) | Match key to value in structured KV pairs. |
| niah_pt_multikey_3 | Retrieval (NIAH) | Retrieve correct values amid noise and distractors (advanced). |
| niah_pt_multivalue | Retrieval (NIAH) | Output all values associated with a single key. |
| niah_pt_multiquery | Retrieval (NIAH) | Handle multiple queries; score each independently. |
| ruler_pt_vt | Multi-Hop Tracing | Follow chained variable assignments to compute final value. |
| ruler_pt_cwe | Aggregation | Identify true top-k frequent words (uniform + noise distribution). |
| ruler_pt_fwe | Aggregation | Rank frequent words (heavy-tailed distribution). |

The RULER Score is computed as a weighted average of all task scores, reflecting the model’s overall capability in handling long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks.

#### G.4.4 HumanEval

We evaluate code generation using the HumanEval benchmark (chen2021codex), originally introduced alongside OpenAI Codex. HumanEval comprises 164 Python programming problems, each defined by a function signature, a natural-language specification, and hidden unit tests that verify functional correctness.

To ensure linguistic consistency with our Portuguese evaluation suite, we simply adapted the instruction prompts from the original HumanEval implementation in the LM-Evaluation-Harness to Portuguese, keeping the function signatures, canonical solutions, and test cases unchanged. No modifications were made to the underlying logic, test harness, or execution protocol. This preserves full comparability with prior work while isolating the effect of prompt language.

All models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting. We report pass@1, which measures the proportion of problems solved correctly by the model’s first generated solution. A solution is considered correct only if it passes all hidden unit tests.

### H.2 Software Stack: the Foundry

Our codebase, Polygl0t/llm-foundry, is a custom open-source stack built on several foundational libraries that supports the entire lifecycle of large language model development, from data processing to model training and evaluation. It integrates several foundational libraries to provide a complete pipeline from data processing to model evaluation:

-
•
PyTorch (paszke2019pytorch): Provides a flexible and performant foundation for distributed training, with native support for Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), and mixed-precision training.

-
•
Hugging Face Transformers (wolf-etal-2020-transformers): Ensures compatibility with the broader ecosystem of pre-trained models, serving also as a standardized way to define and port known architectures.

-
•
vLLM (kwon2023efficient): Provides high-throughput, memory-efficient inference for large language models. We use vLLM for all inference-intensive tasks, including synthetic data generation and LLM-based annotation, achieving up to 4× higher throughput than standard Hugging Face inference via techniques such as PagedAttention and continuous batching.

-
•
Datatrove (penedo2024datatrove): Offers a comprehensive toolkit for large-scale text data processing, including extraction, filtering, and deduplication. Datatrove’s modular pipeline architecture enabled efficient processing of our datasets across distributed CPU nodes.

-
•
Datasets (lhoest-etal-2021-datasets): Provides efficient data loading and processing for large-scale corpora, with support for streaming, memory-mapped access, and distributed caching. We use Datasets extensively for managing training data and evaluation benchmarks.

-
•
SentencePiece (kudo2018sentencepiece): Implements unsupervised text tokenization with efficient training on large corpora.

-
•
LM-Evaluation-Harness (eval-harness): Provides a unified framework for evaluating language models across diverse benchmarks. We extended the harness with Portuguese-specific tasks and used it for all pre- and post-training evaluations, ensuring standardized, reproducible benchmark results.

-
•
TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) (vonwerra2020trl): Offers implementations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization algorithms (DPO, APO). We use TRL for all post-training stages, including instruction fine-tuning and alignment with preference data.

-
•
Mergekit (goddard2025arceesmergekittoolkitmerging): A toolkit for merging pre-trained language models. It uses an out-of-core approach to perform several merging methods, including the tokenizer transplantation we employed for continual pretraining.


#### H.2.1 Distributed Training

We employ two complementary parallelism strategies to train our models:

##### Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

DDP replicates the full model and optimizer state across GPUs and distributes training data across devices. During the backward pass, gradients are averaged across all GPUs using NCCL’s AllReduce collective operation. DDP achieves near-linear scaling efficiency for models that fit comfortably within a single GPU’s memory budget. We use DDP for our smaller models (0.5B–1.5B parameters) when training with modest batch sizes on a small number of nodes.

##### Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP).

FSDP (zhao2023pytorchfsdpexperiencesscaling) implements the ZeRO optimization strategy (rajbhandari2020zeromemoryoptimizationstraining), sharding optimizer states, gradients, and model parameters across the data-parallel dimension. This enables training models that exceed a single GPU’s memory capacity. During the forward pass, FSDP materializes only the parameter shards required for the current layer (via AllGather), while during the backward pass, gradients are reduced and scattered (via ReduceScatter). We primarily use FSDP (v2) with no re-shard after the forward pass (equivalent to ZeRO Stage 2) for our larger model (3.7B parameters).

#### H.2.2 Optimizations

We implement several optimization techniques to maximize training efficiency:

##### Mixed-Precision Training with BF16 and TF32.

All models are trained using BF16 (Brain Float 16) mixed precision, which reduces memory consumption and accelerates matrix operations while maintaining numerical stability better than FP16. BF16 uses the same exponent range as FP32 (8 bits) but reduces the mantissa to 7 bits, eliminating the need for loss scaling while preserving dynamic range. Additionally, we enable TF32 (TensorFloat-32) tensor cores on NVIDIA Ampere GPUs (valero2023mixed).

##### Grouped-Query Attention (GQA).

We implement grouped-query attention (ainslie2023gqatraininggeneralizedmultiquery) across all Tucano2 models, reducing the memory footprint of the key-value cache during inference. GQA groups multiple query heads into a single key-value head, substantially reducing the KV cache size while maintaining model quality.

##### Activation Recomputation (Re-materialization).

Activation Recomputation (chen2016trainingdeepnetssublinear) reduces memory consumption by discarding intermediate activations during the forward pass and recomputing them during the backward pass. This trades computation for memory, enabling training with longer sequences, larger batch sizes, or larger models on fixed hardware.

##### FlashAttention2.

We integrate FlashAttention2 (dao2023flashattention2fasterattentionbetter), a highly optimized attention kernel that fuses attention operations and exploits GPU memory hierarchy to achieve IO-optimal complexity. Unlike standard attention implementations that scale quadratically in memory ( for sequence length ), FlashAttention-2 achieves linear memory complexity () through block-wise computation and on-chip SRAM tiling. On NVIDIA A100 GPUs, FlashAttention-2 reaches up to 73% of theoretical peak FLOPS for attention operations.

##### Fused Triton Kernels via Liger.

We use the Liger Kernel library (hsu2025ligerkernel), which provides highly optimized Triton kernels for common language-model operations. Liger fuses multiple operations into a single GPU kernel, thereby reducing memory bandwidth requirements and kernel-launch overhead. Specifically, we use Liger’s implementations of RMSNorm, RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding, SwiGLU, and Cross-Entropy Loss. Liger’s optimizations yield approximately 20% higher multi-GPU training throughput and up to 60% memory savings compared to standard PyTorch implementations. The memory savings are particularly impactful for cross-entropy computation, as materializing logits for large vocabularies requires substantial GPU memory.

### H.3 Scaling Analysis

To characterize the scalability of our training infrastructure, we conducted a scaling study using a 7B-parameter reference language model with a standard Llama-style architecture. The study was performed on the JUWELS Booster module,888A full description of JUWELS Booster is available in apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/hps/juwels/booster-overview.html. which provides a similar hardware environment in terms of accelerators (NVIDIA A100 GPUs) and interconnect (InfiniBand NDR 200Gb/s).

#### H.3.1 Experimental Setup

| Sequence Length | 4096 tokens |
| Vocabulary Size | 49,152 tokens |

| Micro-Batch Size | 2 samples per GPU (8192 tokens per GPU) |
| Global Batch Size | 1024 samples (4M tokens) |

##### Hardware Configurations.

We evaluated five configurations ranging from 4 nodes (16 GPUs) to 64 nodes (256 GPUs), each node equipped with 4 NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs:

-
•
4 nodes: 16 GPUs, gradient accumulation steps = 32

-
•
8 nodes: 32 GPUs, gradient accumulation steps = 16

-
•
16 nodes: 64 GPUs, gradient accumulation steps = 8

-
•
32 nodes: 128 GPUs, gradient accumulation steps = 4

-
•
64 nodes: 256 GPUs, gradient accumulation steps = 2


#### H.3.2 Scaling Results

Table H.24 presents scaling results across all configurations. We report the time per training step, the achieved tokens per second, the compute utilization (FLOPS per GPU), and the speedup relative to the 4-node baseline.

| Nodes | GPUs | Time/Step (s) | Tokens/s | TFLOPS/GPU | Speedup | Efficiency (%) |
| 4 | 16 | 75.55 | 55,513 | 165.3 | 1.00 | 100.0 |
| 8 | 32 | 38.24 | 109,731 | 163.5 | 1.98 | 98.8 |
| 16 | 64 | 19.72 | 212,676 | 158.4 | 3.83 | 95.8 |
| 32 | 128 | 10.11 | 414,968 | 154.5 | 7.47 | 93.4 |
| 64 | 256 | 5.41 | 774,753 | 144.3 | 13.96 | 87.3 |

##### Key Observations.

-
•
Near-Linear Speedup: Scaling from 4 nodes to 64 nodes (16 increase in hardware) yields a 13.96 speedup, corresponding to 87.3% parallel efficiency.

-
•
Throughput Scaling: Tokens per second increase from 55K (4 nodes) to 775K (64 nodes), enabling efficient training of large models on trillion-token datasets. At the 64-node configuration, the system processes 774K tokens/second, sufficient to complete a 1-trillion-token training run in approximately 15 days of continuous training.

-
•
Model FLOP Utilization: At 4 nodes, we achieve 165 TFLOPS per A100 GPU, corresponding to approximately 53% of the theoretical peak (312 TFLOPS for BF16 operations). As we scale to 64 nodes, FLOPS per GPU decreases slightly to 144 (46%), reflecting increased communication overhead relative to computation. This is expected behavior.

-
•
Communication Overhead: The gradual decrease in parallel efficiency from 98.8% (8 nodes) to 87.3% (64 nodes) indicates increasing communication costs as we scale. FSDP’s AllGather and ReduceScatter collectives dominate communication volume, and their relative cost increases as per-GPU computation decreases.


Figure H.12 presents two complementary views of our scaling results. The left panel shows absolute throughput (tokens/second) and achieved FLOPS as a function of the number of nodes, demonstrating a near-linear increase in processing capacity. The right panel shows speedup relative to the 4-node baseline, along with a reference line indicating perfect linear scaling. The close alignment between observed speedup and the ideal scaling line up to 32 nodes, with only modest deviation at 64 nodes, confirms the scalability of our implementation.

For completeness, we document key system configurations used during training in Table H.25.

### I.2 Optimizer Experiments: AdamW vs. AdamW+Muon

To assess the potential benefits of the Muon optimizer (jordan2024muon) for our training setup, we conducted a controlled pilot study comparing the standard AdamW optimizer against a hybrid AdamW+Muon configuration.

##### Experimental Setup.

We trained two 0.6B-parameter models (identical architecture to Tucano2-0.6B-Base) for 12,000 optimization steps, corresponding to approximately 25 billion tokens (global batch size: 2,097,152 tokens). Both runs used the warmup-stable-decay learning rate schedule (hagele2024scalinglawscomputeoptimaltraining) with 2,000 warmup steps, 9,000 stable steps, and approximately 1,000 cooldown steps (1-sqrt Decay). The AdamW configuration used a maximum learning rate of , while the Muon configuration used . In the hybrid configuration, Muon was applied to all matrix-shaped hidden weights (including attention and feed-forward projections), while AdamW was applied to embeddings, normalization layers, bias terms, and all scalar parameters. The same weight decay coefficient was used for all decayed parameter groups, but Muon and AdamW used different learning rates. AdamW used , , and , while Muon used as its momentum parameter.

##### Evaluation Metrics.

To measure the stability of the training process under both optimizers, we computed gradient-based metrics at each training step by recording the L2 norm of gradients across all model parameters. We define:

-
•
Variability (): The coefficient of variation, computed as the standard deviation divided by the mean gradient norm. This is a relative measure of dispersion, normalized by the average gradient scale.

-
•
Volatility (): The standard deviation of the changes in gradient norms between consecutive steps, where . This metric captures the extent to which the gradient norm fluctuates from step to step.


##### Results.

Table I.27 summarizes the gradient stability metrics for both configurations. The AdamW+Muon configuration exhibits substantially lower volatility (0.0769 vs. 0.1909) and reduced variability (1.6139 vs. 1.7906), suggesting smoother optimization dynamics. Final perplexity scores also favored the AdamW+Muon setup.

| Metric | AdamW | AdamW+Muon |
| Variability () | 1.7906 | 1.6139 |
| Volatility () | 0.1909 | 0.0769 |

Figure I.13 presents the gradient norm trajectories for both configurations throughout the training run.

##### Key Takeaways and Caveats.

The preliminary results suggest that Muon may significantly reduce gradient volatility, potentially contributing to more stable convergence and better generalization. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on a single model size and a relatively short training run. More comprehensive studies across different model scales, training durations, and data mixtures would be needed to fully characterize the benefits and potential trade-offs of using Muon in large-scale LLM training. Nevertheless, based on these encouraging initial results and the growing body of anecdotal evidence from large-scale deployments (nanochat; kimiteam2026kimik2openagentic; liu2025muonscalablellmtraining; chang2025convergencemuon), we adopted AdamW+Muon as part of our full pretraining recipe.

### I.3 Hyperparameter Settings

##### Derivation from Scaling Laws.

We applied the DeepSeek LLM scaling heuristics (deepseekai2024deepseekllmscalingopensource), which relate the compute budget () to optimal hyperparameters via power-law relationships. The compute budget is estimated using the adjusted DeepSeek formulation:

| (2) |

where , , , and tokens. Plugging in these values yields FLOPs. Using the DeepSeek scaling heuristics:

| Max Learning Rate | (3) | |||
| Batch Size | (4) |

We rounded the batch size to the nearest power of two () for hardware efficiency.

##### Weight Decay Strategy.

Following recent best practices from OLMo 2 (olmo20252olmo2furious) and SmolLM 3 (bakouch2025smollm3), we apply weight decay selectively, excluding embeddings and normalization layers.

### I.4 Data Mixture

Tables I.30, I.31, and I.32 provide specifications for the data mixtures used in each training stage. We iteratively refined all proportions and repetition factors during early training checkpoints by monitoring the aggregate NPM score on the Easy Set evaluations.

#### I.4.1 Language Proportions per Stage

Table I.29 summarizes the language distribution across all three training stages. Throughout the training run, we maintain Portuguese as the majority language (63% overall), with the proportion increasing in the final stage to emphasize high-quality native content.

| Stage | Portuguese (%) | English (%) | Steps | Total Tokens |
| Warmup+Stable | 61% (180B) | 39% (112B) | 100,000 | 292B |
| Stable | 54% (76B) | 46% (64B) | 60,000 | 140B |
| 1-sqrt-Decay | 75% (58B) | 25% (20B) | 35,000 | 74B |
| Total | 63% (314B) | 37% (196B) | 195,000 | 408B |

#### I.4.2 Stage 1 (Warmup+Stable) Data Mixture

Stage 1 spans 100,000 optimization steps, corresponding to approximately 292 billion tokens. The learning rate follows a linear warmup for the first 2,000 steps, reaching a peak of for AdamW and for Muon, then remains stable at this peak for the next 98,000 steps. The data mixture emphasizes high-quality educational content from both Portuguese and English sources.

| English Subtotal | 112B (39%) | ||
| Stage 1 Total | 292B |

#### I.4.3 Stage 2 (Stable) Data Mixture

Stage 2 spans 60,000 optimization steps, corresponding to approximately 140 billion tokens. The learning rate remains constant at its peak throughout this stage. The data mixture becomes more diverse, incorporating synthetic data and reasoning-focused datasets.

| Dataset | Subset | Size (Tokens) | Repetition |
| GigaVerbo-v2 | Education Score 4 | 28B | 2 |
| GigaVerbo-v2 Synth | All | 10B | 2 |

| English Subtotal | 64B (46%) | ||
| Stage 2 Total | 140B |

#### I.4.4 Stage 3 (1-sqrt Decay) Data Mixture

Stage 3 spans 35,000 optimization steps, corresponding to approximately 74 billion tokens. The learning rate is annealed from its peak value using a 1/sqrt decay schedule, as recommended by hagele2024scalinglawscomputeoptimaltraining. The data mixture further increases the proportion of Portuguese content to 75%.

| Dataset | Subset | Size (Tokens) | Repetition |

| English Subtotal | 20B (25%) | ||
| Stage 3 Total | 78B |

### I.5 Training Dynamics

Figure I.14 presents the complete gradient norm trajectory throughout the entire training run across all three stages. The gradient norms exhibit expected patterns: a gradual increase during the warmup, stable behavior during the constant-learning-rate phases, and a gradual decay during the final annealing phase. No signs of gradient explosion or vanishing gradients are observed during training.

##### Stage-Specific Behaviors.

During Stage 1 (Warmup+Stable), gradient norms increase smoothly during the warmup phase (steps 0–2,000) and then stabilize with moderate fluctuations. Stage 2 (Stable) exhibits slightly higher variability in gradient norms due to a more diverse data distribution, but remains well within the stable range. Stage 3 (1-sqrt Decay) exhibits a gradually decreasing gradient norm as the learning rate is annealed, consistent with the model converging to a refined final state. These behaviors align with expectations for multi-stage training with WSD schedules (hagele2024scalinglawscomputeoptimaltraining; allal2025smollm2smolgoesbig; bakouch2025smollm3).

- •
-
•
Despite using significantly less compute than Curió-1.1B (which trained on 1 trillion tokens of pretraining and 150 billion tokens of continual pretraining), Tucano2-0.6B-Base achieves comparable overall performance.


## Appendix J Continual Pretraining: Details

This appendix provides supplementary material for the continual pretraining experiments described in Section 8, including OMP-based tokenizer transplantation results, hyperparameter configurations, data mixtures, per-benchmark evaluation results, and the full performance vs. compute breakdown.

### J.1 Tokenizer Transplantation: Initial Results

Table J.35 reports the per-benchmark performance of Qwen3 base models before and after OMP-based tokenizer transplantation. The transplanted models retain a substantial portion of the original performance, especially on Hard Set benchmarks. For instance, the transplanted Qwen3-0.6B already outperforms the from-scratch Tucano2-0.6B-Base on all Hard Set benchmarks despite receiving no additional training. Easy Set degradation is concentrated in token-prediction-sensitive tasks (CALAME, LAMBADA), consistent with the expected impact of vocabulary replacement on next-token prediction distributions.

### J.2 Hyperparameter Settings

Table J.36 provides the complete training configuration for all three continual pretraining runs. Learning rates were selected via systematic sweeps of 10,000 steps each, targeting strong Easy Set performance while preserving the Hard Set capabilities inherited from the Qwen3 base models. The AdamW+Muon optimizer variant used for Tucano2-0.6B-Base was also evaluated in small-scale experiments but consistently underperformed AdamW, likely due to a mismatch between the optimizer state and the Qwen3 pretrained weights.

### J.3 Data Mixture

Table J.37 details the data composition for each continual pretraining run. All mixtures are purely Portuguese, combining curated web text from GigaVerbo-v2 (filtered by education score) with synthetic augmentations from GigaVerbo-v2 Synth. This deliberate shift from the multilingual mixtures used during from-scratch pretraining is intended to maximize Portuguese-specific adaptation within a constrained compute budget. The 1.5B model benefits from a larger training budget (100B tokens), enabling inclusion of lower-threshold web data (education score 3) and additional repetition of high-quality subsets. For the 0.5B and 3.7B models, the data budget was limited to 50B tokens due to project timeline and compute constraints.

| Dataset | 0.5B | 1.5B | 3.7B |
| GigaVerbo-v2 (subset 3) | — | 12B (1) | — |
| GigaVerbo-v2 (subset 4) | 28B (1) | 28B (2) | 28B (1) |

### J.5 Performance vs. Compute

Table J.40 provides a detailed breakdown of compute costs for all evaluated models, including separate accounting of pretraining (PT) and continual pretraining (CPT) FLOPs. Total compute is estimated as .

Even with a limited compute budget for continual pretraining, the Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Base model outperforms all similarly sized models in our evaluation suite. The continual pretraining FLOPs represent a negligible fraction of the total compute: 0.13% for the 3.7B model, 0.25% for the 1.5B model, and 0.12% for the 0.5B model.

## Appendix K Instruct-Completion Quality Annotators: Details

To filter GigaVerbo-v2 SFT at scale, we fine-tuned Qwen3-4B into two quality-assessment models from 500K LLM-annotated interactions.

##### Model Variants.

We developed the following quality-assessment models:

-
•
Classification model (quality scoring): Regression-based continuous score prediction (1–5).

-
•
Conditional generation model (quality explanation): Generates a JSON object ({score, reason}) with a custom chat template.


### K.1 Training Configurations

For both models, we use a custom chat template that converts data in ChatML format into a single string input, and the output is either a scalar score (classification model) or a JSON object (generation model).

##### Training Hyperparameters.

Both models were fine-tuned from Qwen3-4B with the configurations shown in Table K.41.

| Training Configuration | Classification Model | Generation Model |
| Base model | Qwen3-4B | Qwen3-4B |
| Epochs | 2 | 3 |
| Batch size | 64 | 64 |
| Maximum context length | 6,032 tokens | 6,032 tokens |
| Optimizer | AdamW (cosine schedule) | AdamW (cosine schedule) |
| Warmup steps | 100 | 100 |
| Peak learning rate | ||
| Embedding layer | Frozen | Frozen |
| Chat template | Custom | Custom |

### K.2 Evaluation Results

Table K.42 presents the validation performance of both Instruct-Completion Quality Annotators.

| Task | F1 Macro | F1 (3 threshold) | |
| Classification model | Quality scoring | 0.80 | 0.98 |
| Conditional generation model | Quality explanation | 0.72 | 0.88 |

## Appendix L Post-training: Details

This appendix provides additional details on the post-training pipeline described in Section 9, including dataset construction details, quality-assessment model training, full training configurations, per-benchmark results across all model scales, and breakdowns of long-context evaluation.

### L.2 GigaVerbo-v2 SFT: Statistics

Figure L.19 displays the distribution of tokens and quality scores in GigaVerbo-v2 SFT.

### L.3 GigaVerbo-v2 Preferences: Statistics

Table L.44 provides the full composition of the GigaVerbo-v2 Preferences dataset.

| Subset | Examples | Chosen Tok. | Rejected Tok. | Total Tok. |
| Harmless (reasoning) | 9,641 | 6,105,673 | 4,571,353 | 10,677,026 |
| Harmless (no reasoning) | 10,521 | 4,711,020 | 4,057,440 | 8,768,460 |
| Harmful (reasoning) | 4,008 | 1,462,284 | 3,242,908 | 4,705,192 |
| Harmful (no reasoning) | 4,267 | 809,240 | 2,795,035 | 3,604,275 |
| Total | 28,437 | 14,278,217 | 13,666,736 | 27,945,053 |

For the harmless subset, chosen responses were generated by Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct with chain-of-thought reasoning, while rejected responses came from Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. For the harmful subset, chosen responses used safety-oriented constitutions applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, while rejected (compliant) responses were produced by an abliterated variant of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct

### L.4 Constitutional Prompts

All constitutions used in our pipeline are available in Polygl0t/gigaverbo-v2-preferences.

### L.6 Data Mixture

#### L.6.1 Instruct Models

For the Instruct SFT stage, we selected samples with instruct_score across all subsets, except General Instruction Following (where all samples were retained).

| Task Category | Tokens (approx.) | % |
| General Instruction Following | 700M | 80.1 |
| Structured Output Generation | 35M | 4.0 |
| Math and CoT | 27M | 3.1 |
| Function Calling | 17.5M | 2.0 |
| Preference Data (Chosen) | 14M | 1.6 |
| Translation | 5.7M | 0.7 |
| Coding | 2.3M | 0.3 |
| Retrieval Augmented Generation | 2.2M | 0.3 |
| Summarization | 290K | 0.03 |
| Total | 874M |

For Instruct APO, reasoning traces were stripped from preference pairs containing <think></think> tags, allowing all 28,437 pairs to be used:

| Subset | Samples | % |
| Harmless (no reasoning) | 10,521 | 37.0 |
| Harmless (reasoning stripped) | 9,641 | 33.9 |
| Harmful (no reasoning) | 4,267 | 15.0 |
| Harmful (reasoning stripped) | 4,008 | 14.1 |
| Total | 28,437 |

#### L.6.2 Think Models

Think SFT used exclusively reasoning data:

| Task Category | Tokens (approx.) | % |
| Reasoning | 34M | 100 |

Think APO retained only pairs with explicit reasoning traces:

| Subset | Samples | % |
| Harmless (with reasoning) | 9,641 | 70.6 |
| Harmful (with reasoning) | 4,008 | 29.4 |
| Total | 13,649 |

Key differences: (1) Instruct SFT contains 25 more tokens than Think SFT; (2) Instruct strips reasoning traces while Think retains them; (3) Instruct APO uses all 28K pairs while Think APO uses 13.6K pairs with reasoning traces.

#### L.7.3 Instruct and Think Highlights

##### Instruct variants.

Across all parameter scales, the Tucano2 Instruct variants demonstrate consistent advantages on knowledge-intensive and domain-specific benchmarks. Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Instruct achieves the highest Knowledge & Reasoning score among all 3–4B models, with gains distributed across BLUEX, ENEM, OAB, ARC-Challenge, BELEBELE, and MMLU. Mathematical reasoning is a particular strength: on GSM8K-PT, the 3.7B Instruct model scores 53.81, outperforming both Qwen3-4B (39.88) and Gemma-3-Gaia-PT-BR-4b-it (51.29).

##### Think variants.

The comparatively lower aggregate performance of Think variants relative to some baselines can be attributed to: (1) a substantial shortage of high-quality Portuguese reasoning data during training; (2) significantly shorter reasoning traces compared to Qwen3 and SmolLM3; and (3) a constrained 4,096-token context window (roughly half the inference budget available to competing models). Despite these constraints, Tucano2-qwen-3.7B-Think surpasses both Qwen3-4B and SmolLM3-3B on knowledge-intensive benchmarks while reasoning entirely in Portuguese—demonstrating that Portuguese-native chain-of-thought reasoning is viable and competitive even under constrained budgets. Think variants underperform on instruction-following (IFEval-PT) and coding (HumanEval) benchmarks.

##### Think vs. Instruct: HumanEval Degradation.

When reasoning mode is enabled, coding performance (HumanEval) degrades substantially across the hybrid models we evaluated, as shown in Table L.53. Average HumanEval performance drops by 29 percentage points when switching from Instruct to Think mode (inference token budget = 8,192).

| Model | Instruct | Think | |
| Qwen3-4B | 86.59 | 50.61 | 35% |

### L.8 Inference Samples

Below, we provide inference samples from both the Instruct and Think variants of our 3.7B models. While the models still exhibit some signs of hallucinations and verbosity, even in zero-shot settings, they demonstrate substantially improved instruction-following capability compared to the first Tucanos.
